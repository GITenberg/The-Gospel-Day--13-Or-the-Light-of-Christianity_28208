<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Our task is finished. It has not been a disagreeable,
unpleasant one, but joyous. Many times our soul
was blessed and lifted up as the Spirit set before our
mind the wondrous beauty of Christianity. In our
soul we experience a deep sense of gratitude to God
for his aid and guidance in this work. Many were the
prayers we offered unto him for the aid of the Holy
Spirit in the prosecution of this work. He has heard
and answered our prayer, and we are satisfied. Praises
be unto God! We lay no claims to literary ability;
we have not studied to display such talent in this
volume. We have only endeavored to give simple,
plain truth respecting a holy life. We have endeavored
to lift up true Christianity to its proper plane
and to remove as far as possible, the clouds of error
that have long obscured its beautiful, pellucid light.
How far we have succeeded we leave to the reader.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This work would not be much of a production for
some minds, but for ours it is quite an achievement.
It is much more original than we at first intended it to
be: however, we have selected from the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Gospel Trumpet</span></span>
the following subjects: <span class="tei tei-q">“Woman's Freedom,”</span>
<span class="tei tei-q">“Eating of Meat,”</span> and <span class="tei tei-q">“The Sin Against the Holy
Ghost,”</span> which were written by Geo. L. Cole, Russel
Austin, and A. L. Byers, respectively. All other selections
are, we believe, properly acknowledged where
they appear.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Seventy-six pages of the original manuscript were
lost in the mail. This, at first, presented itself as a
discouragement, but we at once remembered that all
things work together for good to them that love the
Lord, consequently we concluded that the Lord wanted
some truth brought out that was not contained in
the first writings; so we set to our task of reproducing
the lost pages with a will, and God has crowned our
efforts with a much greater satisfaction to ourselves.
We now feel we have done what we could, and as this
manuscript leaves our hand it shall be with a prayer
that God will make it a rich blessing to many hearts.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Should this book be the means of lifting up some
weary, despondent soul, or succeed in turning some
sinner from the error of his way, or helping some
deceived one out of his deception, or inspiring some
fallen one to a truer, nobler life, I shall be many,
many times repaid for my labor, and shall indeed
give God the glory. If some one detects an error in
this work do not be hasty in condemning me, but write
me, thus giving me opportunity of explaining the supposed
error, or of humbly confessing my fault. With
deep affection in my soul, I pray the God of heaven
to bless every reader of this book, and kindly ask all
who pray to pray that I may do all the good I can in
this world and gain an eternity in the blissful fields
of heaven. Yours in Christian love,

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In Jesus' name we are here to unveil before
the reader the picture of a beautiful virgin,
whom we shall call Christianity. Never was
there a character seen upon the earth half
so beautiful as she. In her loveliness she has won the
heart of many. The proud and noble have been
brought down to worship at her feet. The lowly have
been lifted up to admire her gracious charms. Peasants
have invited her into their humble homes, where
she reigned as a queen of light and peace. Gloom and
darkness is driven away by her sweet angelic smile.
She has lifted the despondent out of the vortex of
despair, and by her animating presence encouraged
them to bright hopes and a happy life. The bitter
lot of the poor she has sweetened, and the burden and
care of riches takes wings and flies away at her approach.
She has been brought into the presence of
kings and almost won their hearts. Men have sacrificed
the world to gain her love. She is a ray of
heavenly light in this dark world.
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page010">[pg 010]</span><a name="Pg010" id="Pg010" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The words of finite man are inadequate to describe
the true character of Christianity. In our description
we shall exalt her only by the words contained
in the book sent down from heaven. That alone is
worthy to eulogize her name. When the reader has
followed our delineation to the close, and inspected
every feature of this virtuous queen, we trust the decision
of his heart will be yet deeper than his who
said, <span class="tei tei-q">“Almost thou persuadest me to be a Christian.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Christianity should be full of interest to all mankind.
She not only cools the heated brow, cheers the
drooping heart, and strews life's pathway with flowers
of peace, but she deals with man's eternal destiny.
She will smooth the rough places all along his journey
of life, and when he has come down to the end, it is
she that will bear him across the valley and welcome
him to the home prepared for his eternal inhabitancy.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Since the day of her nativity she has had a bitter
obstinate foe, Satan, and wicked men have combined
to bespoil her white robes and mar her fair form.
They have struggled long and hard to bring her low.
They have endeavored to extinguish her radiant light
and defame her true character. We have only to take
a stroll through the halls of denominationalism to
learn how far they have succeeded. To many pews
and pulpits our virgin has no excellence or beauty.
In the pulpit orator's exposition of her she is not
exalted one whit above the coarse, vulgar world. Satan
has succeeded in veiling her fair form and true virtues
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page011">[pg 011]</span><a name="Pg011" id="Pg011" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
from the hearts of many. In the opinions of many she
is reduced to a mere nothing. Angels weep to see her
fair robes trailed in the dust. Those who pretend to
love her have brought her to shame. The low, degrading
opinions entertained regarding her throughout
the realms of sectarianism grieves the souls of her
true admirers. They have brought her down from her
pure, high throne and mingled her with the lives of
ordinary sinful men. They have stripped her of her
clean, white garments and covered her with a cloak
of many colors. They have robbed her of her virtues
and have stained her fair name until to-day all that
is seen of Christianity in the aristocratic circles of
Christendom is a maiden weeping over her stained
vesture, lost virginity and reproached name. Thank
God, such is true only in appearance. True Christianity
is seen by her few devoted followers to-day the
same pure, spotless virgin, the same queen of peace
and light, as when she crowned the brow of the lowly
Nazarene and his immediate followers. She has lost
none of her virtuous charms. She is true. She reigns
a lovely queen, glorious in power, pure in principle,
<span class="tei tei-q">“Clear as the sun, fair as the moon, and terrible as
an army with banners.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Satan has robed a harlot and named her Christianity
and succeeded in imposing her upon many in the
world. They are fondling with her. She indulges
them in sensuality, while encouraging them to hope in
a peaceful immortality. The kings of the earth have
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page012">[pg 012]</span><a name="Pg012" id="Pg012" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
committed fornication with her. They are reveling,
feasting and banqueting with her, crazed by her
seductive charms. She has neither purity, peace, nor
power. Her robes are denied by sin. She scoffs at
pure Christianity and calls her old-fashioned. This
strange young woman is using every device to allure
souls into her wanton chamber. She is most subtle
of heart. She <span class="tei tei-q">“flattereth with her words. In the
twilight, in the evening, in the black and dark night,
she walketh in the streets, and lieth wait at every
corner, that she might catch and kiss him who is void
of understanding.”</span> With a beguiling, impudent face
she says to him: <span class="tei tei-q">“I have peace offerings with me; I
have decked my bed with tapestry, with carved
works, with fine linen of Egypt. I have perfumed my
bed with myrrh, aloes, and cinnamon. Come let us
take our fill of love until the morning: let us solace
ourselves with love.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Such is the gay, fast, frivolous Christianity of the
popular present day religions of our honored land.
The generality of denominational membership (we
speak in love) desire a Christianity that will go with
them to the halls of pleasure; that will dine with them
at the banquets; that will smile on them as they walk
in the ways of sin and worldliness, calming their fears
with her flattering words and peace offerings. Primitive
Christianity, they consider, was good enough for
primitive days, but she would be a horrid enough old
maid in these days of progress. In this fast driving
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page013">[pg 013]</span><a name="Pg013" id="Pg013" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
age the Christianity that crowned the life of the holy
apostles is altogether too antiquated. She drew men
from the world, she crucified their lust, she taught
them to practise self-denial and keep their body in
subjection; she brought them in humility at her feet;
she led them in the paths of virtue and honor; she
upbraided them for sin, and told them of the vengeance
and wrath of God against every evil.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The world to-day, in general, is saying, <span class="tei tei-q">“Away
with such an old-time Christianity; she has no charms
for us. She is too common and plain, too grave and
sober. We will not walk with her; give us the gay
and dashing young harlot that we may walk with her
amid the pleasures of the world, and with her gratify
our lusts. She never chides us for sin, nor troubles
us about the anger of God nor the torments of hell.
She invites us into her bosom and gives us a sweet
opiate draught of <span class="tei tei-q">‘stolen waters and the bread of

to her proper plane and reveal her true character
by relating to the reader the teachings of Christ—her
beloved consort—and the experience and teachings
of his inspired followers, and thus tear off the

Christianity is not a mere profession, but a principle.
Every being is possessed with a principle. Satan
has a principle, which might properly be termed
devilanity; Christ has a principle which is termed
Christianity. When this Christ principle is instilled
into man's soul by the Spirit of God he becomes a
Christian. He possesses the Christ-life, nature, or
principle. Now Christ was the truth. Then the
Christ nature or principle is according to the truth,
whether it be in Christ or man. We have only then to
lift up the whole truth, which by the wisdom and
grace of God we shall do in this work, which will reveal
true Christianity and expose every imposition.
Christ is the vine; Christians are the branches. The
vine and the branches are of the same nature. The
branches retain life by abiding in the vine. They
who abide in Christ walk (or live) even as Christ
walked (or lived); that is, the vine and the branches
bear the same kind of fruit. This is the philosophy
of true Christianity. Anything bearing fruit in
nature contrary to the truth or Christ principle is not
Christianity, but is devilanity. <span class="tei tei-q">“Ye are of your father
the devil, and the lusts of your father will ye
do;”</span> or sinful fruit ye will bear.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Upon reading the account of man's creation in the
first chapters of Genesis we conclude that he enjoyed
perfect peace and happiness. From the beautiful description
given there of the garden of Eden—man's
abode—we understand that God was interested in his
felicity. In the nature of created things he could retain
this happiness only by obedience to the Creator's
laws. By a subtle foe he was induced to transgress
those laws and thus became acquainted with sin and
sorrow. After the transgression he hid himself among
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page017">[pg 017]</span><a name="Pg017" id="Pg017" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the trees of the garden from the presence of the
Lord because a fear rested upon his conscious being.

</div>
</div>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The man was turned out upon the world to earn his
support by labor. The ground was cursed for his
sake. It brought forth thorns and thistles, and in
sorrow he must eat of it all the days of his life.
Cherubims and a flaming sword prevented his return
to the tree of life, which stood in the midst of the
garden. The apostle John in his revelations beheld
this sad scene. He saw the book of life—tree of life—to
be sealed with seven seals, and he saw a strong angel
proclaiming with a loud voice, <span class="tei tei-q">“Who is worthy
to open the book, and to loose the seals thereof? And
no man in heaven, nor in earth, neither under the
earth, was able to open the book, neither to look thereon,”</span>
and he wept much. Rev. 5:1-4. How sad the
scene! Man was created in holiness and happiness.
He dwelt in the garden of Eden and had access to
the tree of life, the very source of peace. But sin
entered his heart. He was driven away to be in
sorrow all his days. No man in heaven nor earth
could secure his return. God saw his wretchedness
and that his <span class="tei tei-q">“wickedness was great in the earth”</span> and
<span class="tei tei-q">“it grieved him at his heart.”</span> Gen. 6:5, 6. Sin
swayed its scepter over the heart of man and he
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page018">[pg 018]</span><a name="Pg018" id="Pg018" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
groaned beneath its tyrannical power, but God's mercy
was not <span class="tei tei-q">“clean gone forever.”</span> They cried unto the
Lord because of the oppressors and he promised to
send them a <span class="tei tei-q">“Savior, and a great one,”</span> to deliver
them. Isa. 19:20. Man was encaged in the prison-house
of sin, but God promised to send a deliverer
<span class="tei tei-q">“to proclaim liberty to the captives, and the opening
of the prison to them that are bound.”</span> Isa. 61:1.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The beloved apostle John, in the vision before mentioned,
wept because no man was found worthy to
open the book; but one of the elders said unto him,
<span class="tei tei-q">“Weep not: behold, the Lion of the tribe of Judah,
the Root of David, hath prevailed to open the book,
and to loose the seven seals thereof.”</span> Praise God!
John in his vision saw the man fall from his pure
and happy state into sin and the book of life becoming
sealed. He also saw that no man in heaven nor earth
was able to restore him to his original place and holiness,
and it caused him to weep. But in his vision
there appeared one who prevailed to open the book
and <span class="tei tei-q">“redeem us unto God out of every kindred and
tongue and people and nation.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In the prophetic days of ancient Israel men who
walked with God and trusted in his promises were
permitted a visionary look down through the centuries
to behold the dawning of a day glorious in the
effulgency of its light and the greatness of its power.
Even in those dim, remote days the wondrous glory
of a day when the <span class="tei tei-q">“Prince of Peace”</span> should come was
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page019">[pg 019]</span><a name="Pg019" id="Pg019" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
foreseen by the prophets, who break forth in beautiful
strains of music, expressing their joy and admiration.
Isaiah in speaking of that expected day says,
<span class="tei tei-q">“Arise, shine; for thy light is come, and the glory
of the Lord is risen upon thee. For, behold, the
darkness shall cover the earth, and gross darkness
the people: but the Lord shall arise upon thee, and
his glory shall be seen upon thee. And the Gentiles
shall come to thy light, and kings to the brightness of
thy rising.”</span> Isa. 60:1-3.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It is a day of wonderful light. When the prophet
speaks of the Gentiles coming to the light the reader
begins to understand the time of the dawning. He
further says, <span class="tei tei-q">“Violence shall no more be heard in
thy land, wasting nor destruction within thy borders;
but thou shalt call thy walls Salvation, and thy gates
Praise. The sun shall be no more thy light by day;
neither for brightness shall the moon give light unto
thee: but the Lord shall be unto thee an everlasting
light, and thy God thy glory. Thy sun shall no more
go down; neither shall thy moon withdraw itself:
for the Lord shall be thine everlasting light, and the
days of thy mourning shall be ended.”</span> Isa. 60:18-20.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The prophet by a long stretch of faith passed
through the gates of Praise to within the walls of
Salvation and beheld a light above the brightness of
the sun and the softness of the moon. We quote these
texts, and the following, to impress the reader's mind
and heart with the greatness of the light and the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page020">[pg 020]</span><a name="Pg020" id="Pg020" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
wonders of that coming day as seen in expectation by
those ancient holy men. After a while we will come
to the dawning, then the noontide, then the evening
of this great day and we will find the glory and the
wonders to be as the prophets foresaw and described.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
What can the holy seer mean by saying, <span class="tei tei-q">“Violence
shall no more be heard in thy land, wasting nor
destruction within thy borders”</span>? We have only to
turn to the eleventh chapter, where we have this
clearly explained. Let us read: <span class="tei tei-q">“And there shall
come forth a rod out of the stem of Jesse, and a
Branch shall grow out of his roots: and the spirit of
the Lord shall rest upon him, the spirit of wisdom
and understanding, the spirit of counsel and might,
the spirit of knowledge and of the fear of the Lord;
and shall make him of quick understanding in the fear
of the Lord: and he shall not judge after the sight of
his eyes, neither reprove after the hearing of his ears;
but with righteousness shall he judge the poor, and reprove
with equity for the meek of the earth: and
he shall smite the earth with the rod of his mouth, and
with the breath of his lips shall he slay the wicked.
And righteousness shall be the girdle of his loins,
and faithfulness the girdle of his reigns. The wolf
also shall dwell with the lamb, and the leopard shall
lie down with the kid; and the calf and the young
lion and the fatling together; and a little child shall
lead them. And the cow and the bear shall feed;
their young ones shall lie down together: and the lion
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page021">[pg 021]</span><a name="Pg021" id="Pg021" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
shall eat straw like the ox. And the sucking child
shall play on the hole of the asp, and the weaned child
shall put his hand on the cockatrice' den. They shall
not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain: for the
earth shall be full of the knowledge of the Lord, as
the waters cover the sea. And in that day there shall
be a root of Jesse, which shall stand for an ensign of
the people; to it shall the Gentiles seek: and his rest
shall be glorious.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Who does not know who is referred to by the words
<span class="tei tei-q">“the Root of Jesse,”</span> whom the Gentiles shall seek,
<span class="tei tei-q">“and his rest shall be glorious”</span>? We hear of one
saying in the New Testament, <span class="tei tei-q">“Come unto me, all ye
that labor and are heavy-laden, and I will give you
rest.”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“Violence shall no more be heard in thy land.”</span>
<span class="tei tei-q">“The wolf shall dwell with the lamb”</span> in the day when
the Gentiles shall seek rest in the Root of Jesse.
This prophecy will never have a literal fulfilment,
as some erroneously teach. It only exalts the salvation
of the Branch of Jesse to deliver men from the
wolf and lion disposition. It is the peacefulness of
Christianity. In the day the prophet is speaking of
there shall be peace on the earth. Man can find deliverance
from sin and obtain a peaceful rest—not
being disturbed by evil and ill dispositions.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Isaiah in again beholding this glorious rest-day discovers
a way which is called the way of holiness.
He says, <span class="tei tei-q">“The unclean shall not pass over it;...
no lion shall be there, nor any ravenous beast shall
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page022">[pg 022]</span><a name="Pg022" id="Pg022" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
go up thereon, it shall not be found there; but the
redeemed shall walk there: and the ransomed of the
Lord shall return, and come to Zion with songs and
everlasting joy upon their heads: they shall obtain
joy and gladness, and sorrow and sighing shall flee
away.”</span> Isa. 35:8-10. Any one can understand that
a literal beast is not meant here when he speaks of a
lion, but that wicked, unclean men can not walk in
the way of holiness—only the redeemed can walk
there.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Earlier in this chapter he speaks of the eyes of the
blind being opened, and the ears of the deaf being
unstopped, and the lame being made to leap as a hart,
and the tongue of the dumb being made to sing.
We have only to read the New Testament to learn
of the fulfilment of this prophecy. In that day men
of unclean, ravenous, and lion-like natures shall find
deliverance and be made gentle, lowly and humble—<span class="tei tei-q">“The
wolf and the lamb shall dwell together.”</span> What
a wonder and expectation must have filled the hearts
of those devout men in those days of darkness and
gloom, as they looked forward to that time when the
blind should see, the deaf hear, and the lame walk;
when there should be no more violence nor destruction
nor wasting, but there should be songs of everlasting
joy, and sorrow and sighing would flee away.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“In that day shall this song be sung in the land of
Judah; we have a strong city; salvation will God appoint
for walls and bulwarks.”</span> Isa. 26:1. In that
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page023">[pg 023]</span><a name="Pg023" id="Pg023" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
day salvation's walls shall surround the people of
God. In the time of this prophet it was stone walls
that surrounded their city, but he looked forward to
a time when the walls of salvation would surround
the city of God. Salvation means deliverance. In
that day the people of God should find a deliverance
or cleansing from sin. It is the gospel day when
Christ should offer a sacrifice for the whole world.
The people cried unto God because of their oppressors,
and he sent them a Savior, and a strong one, to
deliver them. Isa. 19:20.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Were we to turn to the first chapter of the gospel by
Luke we would there learn who this deliverer was.
There we read: <span class="tei tei-q">“Blessed be the Lord God of Israel:
for he hath visited and redeemed his people, and hath
raised up a horn of salvation for us in the house of
his servant David; as he spake by the mouth of his
holy prophets, which have been since the world began:
that we should be saved from our enemies, and from
the hand of all that hate us; to perform the mercy
promised to our fathers, and to remember his holy
covenant; the oath which he sware to our father
Abraham, that he would grant unto us, that we being
delivered out of the hand of our enemies might serve
him without fear, in holiness and righteousness before
him all the days of our life.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
By reading the whole of this chapter you will learn
that this horn of salvation, this deliverer, was the
child Christ Jesus. This deliverer was to appear in
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page024">[pg 024]</span><a name="Pg024" id="Pg024" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
that day. The most simple will at once understand
that the day foreseen and foretold by the holy seers
was the Christian dispensation, or the day of <span class="tei tei-q">“grace
and truth.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The prophet again exclaims: <span class="tei tei-q">“And in that day thou
shalt say, O Lord, I will praise thee: though thou
wast angry with me, thine anger is turned away, and
thou comfortedst me. Behold, God is my salvation;
I will trust, and not be afraid: for the Lord Jehovah
is my strength and my song; he also is become my salvation.
Therefore with joy shall ye draw water out
of the wells of salvation. And in that day shall ye
say, Praise the Lord.”</span> Isa. 12:1-4. <span class="tei tei-q">“In that day
shall the branch of the Lord be beautiful and glorious,
and the fruit of the earth shall be excellent and
comely for them that are escaped of Israel. And it
shall come to pass, that he that is left in Zion, and
he that remaineth in Jerusalem, shall be called holy.”</span>
Isa. 4:2, 3.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The prophet Joel in contemplation of that day of
great blessings says: <span class="tei tei-q">“And it shall come to pass in
that day, that the mountains shall drop down new
wine, and the hills shall flow with milk, and all the
rivers of Judah shall flow with waters, and a fountain
shall come forth of the house of the Lord, and shall
water the valley of Shittim.”</span> Joel 3:18.

That day seen so far away by those righteous men
awakened songs of praise in their hearts. They were
not speaking of the eternal day in the glory world;
neither of a supposed millennial age, but of this present
glorious dispensation of grace and salvation. It
requires only two texts to clearly prove this. The
first is Isa. 49:8: <span class="tei tei-q">“Thus saith the Lord, In an acceptable
time have I heard thee, and in a day of salvation
have I helped thee.”</span> The second is found in
2 Cor. 6:2. Paul here quotes this promise the Lord
made, and then says, <span class="tei tei-q">“Behold now is the accepted
time; behold, now is the day of salvation.”</span> Again
in Rom. 13:12 the apostle speaks of his having arrived
at that day. He says, <span class="tei tei-q">“The night is far spent,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page027">[pg 027]</span><a name="Pg027" id="Pg027" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the day is at hand, let us therefore cast off the works
of darkness, and let us put on the armor of light.”</span>
How beautiful! The Christian's armor in the <span class="tei tei-q">“day
of salvation”</span> is one of light, the darkness is flown
away. The Old Testament writer said that in that
day God would send a Savior. In the New Testament
it is recorded that <span class="tei tei-q">“unto you is born this day in the
city of David a Savior, which is Christ the Lord.”</span>
The Savior God had promised was the Christ, and the
day was now come.

By many a prophetic Old Testament text that day
of wonderful light and glory was spoken of as a day
when God's salvation should appear. In the second
chapter of Luke it is recorded that there lived in Jerusalem
a just and devout man, who knowing those
prophetic sayings concerning that great day of consolation,
waited for its dawning. It was revealed unto
him by the Holy Spirit that he should not see death,
before he had seen the Lord's Christ. He came by
the Spirit into the temple: and when the parents
brought in the child Jesus, to do for him after the custom
of the law, then took he him up in his arms, and
blessed God, and said, <span class="tei tei-q">“Lord, now lettest thou thy
servant depart in peace, according to thy word: for
mine eyes have seen thy salvation.”</span> Simeon, as he
looked upon this young child, saw the salvation the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page028">[pg 028]</span><a name="Pg028" id="Pg028" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
ancient prophets saw only by faith. The day of which
they prophesied the Holy Spirit witnessed to his heart
he should live to see, and he saw it. It was the dawning
of the day of Christian power and purity, in
which we shall find came to pass all the prophetic
wonders of salvation. You need not look forward to
some marvelous coming age in which to find a fulfilment
of these prophecies, but <span class="tei tei-q">“to-day if ye will hear
his voice, harden not your hearts.”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“How shall we
escape if we neglect so great salvation?”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
For convenience and clearness we have thought
best to divide this work into three parts. Part first
to consist of the revealing of Christianity as seen in
the life and teaching of Christ and the teaching
and lives of his followers during the first few centuries
of this Christian era, which is termed the morning
of the gospel day. Part second will consist of the
apostolic prophecies with possibly a few Old Testament
prophecies concerning an apostasy during the
middle centuries, or, the noontide of the gospel day;
also showing that these prophecies find an exact fulfilment
in the customs and doings of the popular religious
denominations of this present time. Part third
will consist of the prophecies relating to the restoration
of the glorious truths of Christianity, or a return
of God's people to the apostolic plane of Christian faith
and power and teaching in the evening of this day
of salvation. With this introduction we feel confident
the reader understands the plan of this work and will
readily comprehend its teachings. <span class="tei tei-q">“Consider what
I say; and the Lord give thee understanding,”</span> is my
prayer.

In this division of this work we desire to set forth
in a clear, comprehensive manner the true character
and principles of Christianity as seen in the teachings
of the Holy Scriptures. The Bible is our only
source of knowledge respecting the true nature of a
Christian life. Man may presume, but the Scriptural
declarations are in verity. The New Testament sets
forth in such clearness the nature of a Christian heart
and the conduct that naturally issues from such a
heart that none need be deceived as to their spiritual
standing. Christianity is in absolute and perfect accord
with the Holy Scriptures. This is a fact that
all must concede. No matter what may be the philosophy
and theory of man, Christianity is just what
the Bible plainly declares it to be. A life that is out
of harmony with the sacred truth can not be a Christian
life. For this reason we desire to set forth the
principal teachings of the New Testament respecting
practical Christianity.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Throughout the Scriptures Christianity is spoken
of as a light. The Christian era is referred to as a day.
A day is when the light shineth. In speaking of the
beautiful dawning of the Star of Christianity the
prophet says: <span class="tei tei-q">“And the Gentiles shall come to thy
light, and kings to the brightness of thy rising.”</span>
<span class="tei tei-q">“Arise, shine; for thy light is come.”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“The sun shall
be no more thy light by day; neither for brightness
shall the moon give light unto thee: but the Lord
shall be unto thee an everlasting light, and thy God
thy glory.”</span> Isa. 60. It is not meant to say here that
Christians have no need of the light of the sun or
the moon, but to teach that the light of the sun and
the brightness of the moon is not to be compared to
the transcendent light of Christianity. Whose heart
has not been touched with a feeling of admiration as
they beheld the bright dawning of the round, red
sun, or the beautiful rising of a full moon? These
are not to be compared with the <span class="tei tei-q">“brightness of the
rising”</span> of the gospel day. <span class="tei tei-q">“To them which sat in
the region and shadow of death light is sprung up.”</span>
Mat. 4:16. <span class="tei tei-q">“Through the tender mercy of our God,
whereby the dayspring [sun rising—margin] from
on high hath visited us, to give light to them that
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page031">[pg 031]</span><a name="Pg031" id="Pg031" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
sit in darkness and in the shadow of death, to guide
our feet into the way of peace.”</span> Luke 1:78, 79.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Jesus says of himself, <span class="tei tei-q">“I am the root and the offspring
of David, and the bright and morning star.”</span>
Rev. 22:16. Christ speaking to the church at Thyatira,
says to those that overcome and keep his works
unto the end, that he will give them the morning
star. Rev. 2:28. He will give them the true light
and glory of Christianity, or his own light and nature.
All will do well to take heed to do his works
<span class="tei tei-q">“until the day dawn and the day star arise in their
hearts.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In the natural world there is a literal solar system
consisting of the sun, moon and planets. The sun is
the center around which all the planets revolve, and
from which they receive their light. The moon borrows
its light from the sun. When some object interposes
between the moon and the sun the moon is
left in darkness. In the spiritual world there is a
spiritual solar system consisting of sun, moon and
stars. As in the literal system, the moon and stars
revolve around the Sun and borrow their light therefrom.

<h3 class="tei tei-head" style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 2.40em; margin-top: 2.40em"><span style="font-size: 120%">The Spiritual Sun Or Light.</span></h3>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It is not difficult to glean from the Scriptures
the knowledge of the true center of this spiritual
solar system, or the true source of light. The last
writer of the Old Testament Scriptures, in his last
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page032">[pg 032]</span><a name="Pg032" id="Pg032" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
chapter says: <span class="tei tei-q">“But unto you that fear my name shall
the Sun of righteousness arise with healing in his
wings.”</span> All understand this text to refer to the
Lord Jesus. His visitation to this world, through the
mercy of God, is termed, <span class="tei tei-q">“The sun-rising.”</span> Luke 1:78,
margin. Christ is the Sun and true source of
light of the gospel day. The church of God collectively
is the moon of this spiritual solar system, and
its individual members are the stars. In the Savior's
prophecy as recorded in Mark 13:24, 25, the term
<span class="tei tei-q">“sun”</span> is a metaphor, signifying Christ; the <span class="tei tei-q">“moon,”</span>
the church, as a whole; the <span class="tei tei-q">“stars,”</span> Christians, or
especially the ministry.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This darkening of the sun and moon and the falling
of the stars we will clearly explain in part second
of this work. The church of God receives its
light from Jesus. He is <span class="tei tei-q">“the light of the world.”</span>
In the language of Isa. 60:1 the church is addressed:
<span class="tei tei-q">“Arise, shine; for thy light is come.”</span> Christ is her
light. The church shines by the light of Christ, as
the moon shines by the light of the sun. <span class="tei tei-q">“Out of
Zion [the church of God], the perfection of beauty,
God hath shined.”</span> The church as a whole is a brilliant
reflector to reflect the light of Christ to this universe.
Every Christian is a bright spot in this luminous
reflector. Amen. <span class="tei tei-q">“Let your light so shine.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
A few years ago, one beautiful Sunday summer
evening, as we were on our way to an appointed
meeting, we observed the moon rising in the splendor
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page033">[pg 033]</span><a name="Pg033" id="Pg033" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of its fulness. It shed its soft, peaceful rays over the
earth in marked beauty. After a short time we became
aware of a gathering darkness. On looking up
we saw a dark object gathering over the moon. Slowly,
but surely the dark object crept on until all was
darkened. Not one ray of light fell from the moon.
The sun had ceased to shine upon her. We understood
that the world had come in between the sun and the
moon and obstructed the sun's rays. The same is
true of the spiritual moon, the church. In the first
few centuries of this Christian day it shone with the
light and glory of God, but the time came when the
<span class="tei tei-q">“moon [church] ceased to give her light,”</span> and all because,
as we will learn, the world came between it
and the Sun (Christ).

<h3 class="tei tei-head" style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 2.40em; margin-top: 2.40em"><span style="font-size: 120%">Christian Power And Purity.</span></h3>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Christianity is a light in this world because of the
greatness of its power and the excellence of its purity.
John, who is denominated the forerunner of
Jesus, or the heralding star of Christianity, said that
<span class="tei tei-q">“he was not that Light, but was sent to bear witness
of that Light. That was the true Light, which lighteth
every man that cometh into the world.”</span> John 1:8, 9.
Of whom speaketh the prophet then? The Son of
God will answer this question in these words: <span class="tei tei-q">“I am
the light of the world: he that followeth me shall not
walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life.”</span>
John 8:12. Jesus was the light of the world because
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page034">[pg 034]</span><a name="Pg034" id="Pg034" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of his power and purity. All power was given unto
him in heaven and in earth. Mat. 28:18.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
He was holy, harmless and undefiled. Heb. 7:26.
The Lord Jesus lived a pure and holy life. <span class="tei tei-q">“He did
no sin, neither was guile found in his mouth.”</span> He
had power to open the blind eyes, to unstop the deaf
ears, to loose the dumb tongue, to make the lame
man leap as a hart, and to heal all manner of diseases,
and to raise the dead. There is no sin in heaven; there
is no sickness there. He brought the light of heaven
to this world in displaying his power over sin and
disease. Glory to his name!
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
We wish to impress this fact upon the reader's
mind that he was a light because of his purity and
power, and because he was the <span class="tei tei-q">“Truth.”</span> And now
if you will but believe it, that is the true light of
Christianity. The Lord Jesus was only a visitant.
His stay on earth was transient. He came from heaven,
and heaven soon again received him. Referring
to his departure he said to his disciples: <span class="tei tei-q">“Yet a little
while is the light with you. Walk while ye have
the light; ... while ye have light, believe in the
light, that ye may be the children of light.”</span> John
12:35, 36.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Again he says, <span class="tei tei-q">“As long as I am in the world, I am
the light of the world.”</span> John 9:5. We learn the sad
story of his crucifixion, then the glad news of his
resurrection, and then his ascension in a cloud to the
glory, from whence he came. Is the light of Christianity
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page035">[pg 035]</span><a name="Pg035" id="Pg035" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
gone from the world? Is this world left again
in darkness? No; thank God! Jesus now says to his
devoted followers: <span class="tei tei-q">“Ye are the light of the world. A
city that is set on a hill can not be hid.”</span> Mat. 5:14.
It is the <span class="tei tei-q">“city of Zion, the perfection of beauty,”</span>
out of which God doth shine. <span class="tei tei-q">“The glory of God is
risen upon her.”</span> Jesus told them to believe in the
light while they had the light, that they might be the
children of light. Paul, in exhorting Christians to
a holy life, said: <span class="tei tei-q">“That ye may be blameless and
harmless, the sons of God, without rebuke, in the
midst of a crooked and perverse nation, among whom
ye shine as lights in the world.”</span> Phil. 2:15. <span class="tei tei-q">“For
ye were sometimes darkness, but now are ye light in
the Lord: walk as children of light.”</span> Eph. 5:8.
<span class="tei tei-q">“Ye are all the children of light, and the children of
the day: we are not of the night, nor of darkness.”</span>
1 Thes. 5:5.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This is the spiritual moon reflecting the light of
the Sun. It is <span class="tei tei-q">“God that shineth in thee.”</span> They
are <span class="tei tei-q">“light in the Lord,”</span> and they are commanded to
<span class="tei tei-q">“let their light shine, that God might be glorified.”</span>
This is beautiful. Oh, what a privilege

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
How can the Lord now, since his ascension, shine
through his church? The Scriptures make this very
plain. Jesus told his own that he would not long be
with them, but said, <span class="tei tei-q">“I will pray the Father, and he
shall give you another Comforter, that he may abide
with you forever; even the Spirit of truth; whom the
world can not receive, because it seeth him not, neither
knoweth him: but ye know him for he dwelleth with
you, and shall be in you. I will not leave you comfortless:
I will come to you.”</span> John 14:16-18.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In verse twenty-six he tells us the Comforter is the
Holy Ghost. In the second chapter of Acts we have
the account of the Holy Spirit's coming. If you
will again look over the quotation from John 14:16-18
you will notice he uses <span class="tei tei-q">“Comforter”</span> and <span class="tei tei-q">“I”</span> interchangeably.
He will give you another Comforter.
<span class="tei tei-q">“I will not leave you comfortless: I will
come to you.”</span> The Holy Spirit's coming on Pentecost
was Christ in another personage. Christ in the
Spirit has now come to dwell in the midst of his
people, and to be a light in them. Jesus was here in
the body on a mission of mercy. He tasted death for
every man. He comes again in the Spirit to <span class="tei tei-q">“reprove
the world of righteousness, of sin, and of judgment.”</span>
In Heb. 10:5 Jesus says, <span class="tei tei-q">“A body hast thou prepared
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page037">[pg 037]</span><a name="Pg037" id="Pg037" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
me.”</span> A body in which to offer a sacrifice for
the sins of the world. He now has a body in which he
dwells in the Spirit. Christians are <span class="tei tei-q">“a holy temple
in the Lord, in whom they are builded together for a
habitation of God through the Spirit.”</span> Thus God
inhabits his people, <span class="tei tei-q">“dwells in them, and walks in
them.”</span> The church of God is now the body of Christ.
He is the <span class="tei tei-q">“head over all things to the church, which
is his body.”</span> Eph. 1:22, 23; see also Col. 1:18.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In speaking of saints in 1 Cor. 12:27 the apostle
says, <span class="tei tei-q">“Now ye are the body of Christ and members
in particular.”</span> He was the light of the world in
his incarnation, and now the church, his body, is
the light of the world. Incarnate he was a light because
of his purity and power, and he lives the same
pure life and manifests the same marvelous power
in his body, the church, as when here in his personal
ministry. He healed the sick, cast out devils, opened
blinded eyes, unstopped deaf ears, and raised the
dead. After the Holy Spirit's coming he performs
the same wondrous works in his body, the church.
Through the apostle Peter he healed a lame man,
restored to life a dead woman, etc. He is <span class="tei tei-q">“the very
same Jesus.”</span> When he was here in the flesh he could
be seen and his marvelous works witnessed by the
natural eye. The Holy Spirit is imperceptible to
the natural eye, and therefore can only reveal himself
to the world as he works in the midst of his
people. It is thus that Christians reflect the light of
Christ.

In the sixteenth of Mark the Lord commanded his
disciples to go <span class="tei tei-q">“into all the world, and preach the
gospel to every creature. He that believeth and is
baptized shall be saved; but he that believeth not
shall be damned. And these signs shall follow them
that believe; in my name shall they cast out devils;
they shall speak with new tongues; they shall take up
serpents; and if they drink any deadly thing, it shall
not hurt them; they shall lay hands on the sick, and
they shall recover. So then after the Lord had spoken
unto them, he was received up into heaven, and sat
on the right hand of God.”</span> Ver. 15-19.

In verse twenty it is said, <span class="tei tei-q">“They [the disciples]
went forth and preached everywhere, the Lord working
with them, and confirming the word with signs
following.”</span> The Lord worked with them; then he
must have returned. He did in the manner we have
told you. He returned to be a light in the midst of
his people by confirming the truth wherever it is
lifted up. He did do it, and he now does it. God
bears witness to his truth, both with signs and wonders,
and divers miracles, and gifts of the Holy Ghost.
Heb. 2:4. For Christianity to be a light there must
be the performance of signs and wonders and divers
miracles. Such is true Christianity, and such is
her light, a queen swaying her scepter over the works
of Satan, setting at liberty the captives, breaking the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page039">[pg 039]</span><a name="Pg039" id="Pg039" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

scattering peace and bright hopes in the hearts of
men. Glory to God forevermore!

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Not only does the Lord dwell in the midst of his
people to perform deeds and signs of wonder, but
he dwells in them in all the beauty of his holiness.
In their hearts he rules a <span class="tei tei-q">“King of peace”</span> and purity.
Those in whom he dwells <span class="tei tei-q">“walk even as he walked,”</span>
and <span class="tei tei-q">“as he is, so are they in this world.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
A certain writer speaks thus of the beauties of
Christian character: <span class="tei tei-q">“Live as we may, age dims the
luster of the eye, and pales the flush of the cheek,
while infirmity mars the human form divine. But
while this is true, dim as the eye is, pallid and sunken
as may be the face of beauty, frail and feeble
that once strong, erect and symmetrical form, the
immortal soul, just fledging its wings for heaven,
may look out through those faded windows, as beautiful
as a dewdrop on a summer's morning, as melting
as the tears that glisten in affection's eye, by
growing kindly, by cultivating sympathy with all
mankind, by cherishing forbearance toward the follies
and fribbles of our race, and feeding day by day on
that love of God and man which lifts us from the
brute and makes us akin to angels.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Christian character is the same whether it be in
Christians or in Christ. The character of the Savior is
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page040">[pg 040]</span><a name="Pg040" id="Pg040" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
also the character of those in whom he dwells. Their
nature is the same, and their outward life is the
same. This is what is meant when it is said: <span class="tei tei-q">“We
should walk even as he walked.”</span> For the clear proof
of these few assertions we will arrange in parallel
columns a few texts of Scripture describing the character
of Jesus and a few describing the character of
Christians, and we will find that not anything more
is said of the Savior with respect to a holy life than
is said of his devoted followers.

Thus we could go on to a much greater length,
showing by the Scriptures that the character of a
Christian, or his nature or life is the same as the
life or character of Christ. Christianity is Christ in
us. The life of a true Christian is one of great
beauty. It is a light in this world. It is far above the
ways of sin and worldliness. It is the Christ-life
in man. The self-life of man has ceased, is crucified;
nevertheless he lives, yet not he, but it is Christ
that liveth in him. The Christian life is inspiring,
ennobling, clothed in humility. It points the way to
Christ and heaven. It is a brilliant ornament, which
in the sight of God is of great price. God places great
value upon a Christian life. It is worth more than
ten thousand worlds. Is it not a shame that it is
trifled with as it is? Thousands are taking the name
of Christian, when it is impossible to distinguish them
from the world; they emit not one ray of light.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Esthetics is the science of the beautiful, and treats
of the feelings produced through the senses by objects
of beauty. The most vile and dishonest admire
honesty in others; thus gentleness, kindness, meekness,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page044">[pg 044]</span><a name="Pg044" id="Pg044" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
produce pleasant feelings and are called beautiful.
God is the source of meekness, gentleness, and love.
He is the source of the beautiful. Christianity is God
in man, exhibiting his beauty. <span class="tei tei-q">“Lord, let thy beauty
be upon us.”</span> The dewdrop sparkles like a diamond
as the sun's rays fall upon it. The life of man
sparkles with an unsurpassed beauty as the rays of
light and salvation fall upon it from the throne. As
we behold the beauty of God assimilated into the life
of man and thus revealed we think what a pity that
all in the world are not Christians.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
We have said before that Christianity is in perfect
accord with the Bible. The Word of God reveals
Christianity to us. It is an infallible expression of
its doctrines and duties. Jesus is the way to everlasting
rest; the Bible is the guide. Some one has said,
<span class="tei tei-q">“Both are equally certain, equally divine. Let us
be thankful for such unspeakable gifts. Next to the
mercy of a Savior, able and ready to save to the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page045">[pg 045]</span><a name="Pg045" id="Pg045" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
uttermost all who come unto God by him, is the book
of inspiration of God, which as a lamp to our feet,
and a light to our path, conducts us to such a Friend,
and teaches us the way of salvation.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The Word of God is a lamp and a light to guide to
everlasting bliss, <span class="tei tei-q">“The entrance of thy word giveth
light.”</span> The word is written in the Christian's heart.
In his conduct he adorns the doctrine of God our Savior
and thus reveals the light of the gospel. Christianity
is therefore a light, because it is a product of the
truth. We can understand at once then that anything
that is in opposition to the Scriptures can not
be a light. The nearer the life accords with the whole
truth the greater the light. The Scriptures contain
all that is necessary for the formation of a perfect
Christian. Whosoever submits heart and life to the
Word of God and walks in obedience to its commands
will be transformed into the glorious image of the
Son of God and made ready for that better land.
The apostle says, <span class="tei tei-q">“All scripture is given by inspiration
of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof,
for correction, for instruction in righteousness: that
the man of God may be perfect [a perfect Christian],
thoroughly furnished unto all good works.”</span> 2 Tim.
3:16, 17.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Tradition is unnecessary for the production of a
true Christian character. The Scriptures contain all
the doctrine, reproof, correction and instruction needful.
The Scriptures have but one true interpreter,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page046">[pg 046]</span><a name="Pg046" id="Pg046" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
and but one interpretation. All who rightly understand
the Bible understand it alike. We are aware
this is contrary to much of the present day teaching.
Many are now saying that <span class="tei tei-q">“we can not understand
the Word of God the same, therefore just as we understand
it so it is unto us.”</span> This is very loose and robs
the <span class="tei tei-q">“two-edged sword”</span> of all its sharpness and power.
It leaves man to interpret it in a manner that will not
condemn his sinful life. A class of grammar students,
if allowed to analyze sentences and parse words each
according to his understanding, would never become
perfect grammarians. One may parse a word as a
<span class="tei tei-q">“verb,”</span> another the same word as an <span class="tei tei-q">“adverb,”</span>
another as a <span class="tei tei-q">“participle,”</span> and if each were right according
to his understanding, how could we have
any fixed rules of grammar? All would be confusion
and no one would know what is proper speech.
Students to become efficient scholars must understand
mathematics, astronomy, botany, etc., alike. Every
volume written by man if understood rightly must
be understood alike by all.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
To allow every man his own private interpretation
of Scripture, or every religious society its interpretation
is to admit of no certain, no fixed rules governing
a Christian life. We can illustrate it better in
this way. A certain rich man has a number of circulars
printed. These circulars he distributes among
the poor of a certain neighborhood. On these circulars
he tells them that at the end of twelve months he
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page047">[pg 047]</span><a name="Pg047" id="Pg047" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
will give one thousand dollars to each one complying
with the conditions given below. The conditions are
these: You must not steal. <span class="tei tei-q">“Lie not one to another.”</span>
Do not render evil for evil. Love your enemies, and
pray for those who despitefully use you. <span class="tei tei-q">“If thine
enemy hunger, feed him; and if he thirst, give him
drink.”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“Speak evil of no man.”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“Return good
for evil.”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“As ye would that others should do to
you, do ye even so to them.”</span> If a man smite you
upon the right cheek, turn to him the other also.
Prefer others before yourself. <span class="tei tei-q">“Do all things without
murmuring.”</span> Do not wear gold or pearls or costly
array. Pray when you are afflicted. Do not jest or
talk foolishly, but have a sound speech. Greet one
another with a kiss. Wash one another's feet. You
must all speak the same thing. You must be of one
mind. If ye do these things you shall receive the
inheritance, but he that offends in one is guilty of
all.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Now who of a sound mind could not understand
as plain and simple language as this? But suppose
one man or woman does not want to lay off their gold
and pearls, so they decide he meant that for women
of ancient times and not for us. Another thinks the
command to greet with a kiss means to shake hands.
Another thinks to visit my neighbor when he is
sick is washing his feet. To pray when we are afflicted
is meant for the people of olden time. One man whose
heart is full of hatred against a neighbor decides
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page048">[pg 048]</span><a name="Pg048" id="Pg048" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
no man can love his enemy, therefore this command
does not mean what it says, so he will go on hating
his enemy, but expects to get his inheritance. One
man decides one command means one thing, another
that it means something else, each one making each
command to mean that which is most pleasing to
do. Who would receive the one thousand dollars
at the time appointed? You can at once see the folly
of their entertaining hopes of receiving the inheritance.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Thousands are thus treating the Word of God,
saying this and that commandment does not mean
what it says, but means thus and so, or, it was for
a people of some other time, etc. At this present
day there are many who are taking the traditions of
men and customs of some religious society for their
rule of life and duty.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Recently while passing through a strange part of
the country we stopped at a farmhouse to inquire
our way. It became convenient to tell the lady, who
came to answer our inquiry, that we had come into
her neighborhood to hold a few religious meetings.
She invited us into her house to see her four weeks'
old baby which was sick. While talking with her she
said that she became afraid that her child was going
to die, so she sent for the minister and had it christened.
I asked her if she believed that if the babe
had died without being christened that it would have
gone to hell. <span class="tei tei-q">“No,”</span> she said, <span class="tei tei-q">“I do not believe
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page049">[pg 049]</span><a name="Pg049" id="Pg049" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
that, but I believe that it would have gone to heaven.”</span>
I then asked her, Do you not believe that if your
little child lives that it will go into sin and some day
will have to repent and be converted in order to get
to heaven just the same as if it never had been
christened? She said that she believed it would. I
then asked her what good the christening had done
her child. She answered, <span class="tei tei-q">“I do not know.”</span> I then
asked her to give me one commandment in the Bible
obligating her to christen her child. She said, <span class="tei tei-q">“I know
of none.”</span> I then asked her why she had her babe
christened. She said, <span class="tei tei-q">“Because most all the people
do around here.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
She like thousands of others was taking the custom
of the neighborhood, or religious order, and never
searched the Scriptures to know what are the commandments
of God. We need to be doers only of the
Word of God. <span class="tei tei-q">“Not every one that saith, Lord, Lord,
shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that
doeth the will of my Father which is in heaven.”</span>
The God of heaven has given laws and fixed rules and
recorded them in the Holy Scriptures to govern our
daily life. These laws we are positively commanded
to obey. To disobey is a sin. 1 John 3:4. Sinners
do not go to heaven. There is not one text in the
whole Bible encouraging us to hope of going to
heaven if we are knowingly disobeying any commandment
of God. In this present day a mighty concourse
of people are passing on down the way to an
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page050">[pg 050]</span><a name="Pg050" id="Pg050" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
eternity, professing to be children of God, but living
careless and negligent, doing many things they should
not do, and failing to do a great many things they
should do.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This greatly reminds me of the way the people
regarded a certain stock law that was passed by the
legislature of our district in my boyhood days. This
law forbade the running at large of cattle, hogs, sheep,
etc. Now there was in our neighborhood much of
what was called <span class="tei tei-q">“commons.”</span> It was unfenced land,
and was used as a common pasture land for all. Consequently
the enacting of such a law was obnoxious
to nearly all of the citizens of this neighborhood,
and it was almost unanimously violated; and because
it was violated by so many it was never enforced.
Cattle, sheep, and hogs continued to run at large the
same as if there was no law prohibiting the same.
After a time most people had forgotten there was
such a law.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The same is true respecting the Word of God.
People have gone on in their own ways, violating
those holy laws until many are doing things, and
do not know there is a law of God forbidding it.
God's laws are not held in the high esteem they should
be. They are his power unto salvation to all that
believe. They are able to save the soul. They are
to be kept in remembrance, to be kept in the heart,
to be obeyed. They are to search, to meditate upon,
to trust in, to rejoice in, to delight in, to taste, to
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page051">[pg 051]</span><a name="Pg051" id="Pg051" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
long after, to stand in awe of, to esteem as a light,
and to be let dwell richly within us. It is the Word
of God that shall judge us in that great judgment-day.
They that love God and keep his words, <span class="tei tei-q">“against
such there is no law;”</span> consequently they will <span class="tei tei-q">“have
boldness in that day.”</span> God's law is eternal; it shall
never pass away. The Lord Jesus says, <span class="tei tei-q">“Heaven and
earth shall pass away, but my words shall never pass
away.”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“The word of God which liveth and abideth
forever.”</span> 1 Pet. 1:23.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The time was when there was no sin in this world.
At that time it was an Eden. By man transgressing
God's holy law sin entered this world. <span class="tei tei-q">“Wherefore,
as by one man sin entered into the world, and death
by sin; and so death passed upon all men, for that
all have sinned.”</span> Rom. 5:12. This is the origin of
sin in this world and the awful consequence. God's
design was that his creation be sinless and pure, but
by disobedience sin has marred the scene of God's
creative purity. The following texts will acquaint
the reader with the characteristics or nature of sin.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
1. <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Sin is defiling.</span></em> <span class="tei tei-q">“There is a generation that are
pure in their own eyes, and yet is not washed from
their filthiness.”</span> Prov. 30:12. <span class="tei tei-q">“Though your sins
be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though
they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool.”</span> Isa.
1:18. Here we see the defiling nature of sin. It
stains the soul as with scarlet. White is the emblem
of purity. The pure soul is spoken of as being clothed
in <span class="tei tei-q">“fine linen, clean and white.”</span> Sin stains those
robes with crimson, or scarlet spots. Though you
wash with niter, or with much soap, those deep-dyed
marks of iniquity can not be thus cleansed away.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
2. <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Sin is deceiving.</span></em> <span class="tei tei-q">“But exhort one another daily,
while it is called to-day; lest any of you be hardened
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page053">[pg 053]</span><a name="Pg053" id="Pg053" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
through the deceitfulness of sin.”</span> Heb. 3:13. One
sin has opened the gate or way to many more. There
is a kind of opiate power in sin that renders its victim
unconscious of its awful magnitude, thus its
deceitfulness.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
3. <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Sin is reproachful.</span></em> <span class="tei tei-q">“Righteousness exalteth
a nation: but sin is a reproach to any people.”</span> Prov.
14:34. We can not enable you to see that sin is a
reproach in any better way than by placing two pictures
before you. One picture is that of a community
where all the citizens, old and young, love and fear
God. They live together in peace and love; there are
no quarrelings or contentions, envyings or unkindnesses
among neighbors, neither in home life. There
is no stealing, lying, cheating, swearing, drunkenness,
fightings, backbitings, vulgarisms, unholy revelries,
etc. Such manner of life exalts that community, and
all good people are desirous of making their homes
there.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The second picture is that of a community where
neighbors are quarreling, hating and lawing with
each other. In home life there are angry words and
bitter feelings and estrangements. There are lewd
revelries and wanton pleasures. There are stealings
and lyings, cheatings, fightings, swearings, drinking,
chewing and smoking, slang phrases, etc. Such is a
reproach, and thus we learn how righteousness exalts
a nation and sin becomes a reproach to any
people.
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page054">[pg 054]</span><a name="Pg054" id="Pg054" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
4. <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Sin gives death its horror.</span></em> <span class="tei tei-q">“The sting of death
is sin.”</span> 1 Cor. 15:56. Many a thing in this world
carries a sting by which it inflicts pain. Death and
the thoughts of death are painful and cause a shudder
and fear because death has a sting. It is sin.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
5. <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Sin excludes the soul from heaven.</span></em> <span class="tei tei-q">“Then said
Jesus again unto them, I go my way, and ye shall
seek me, and shall die in your sins: whither I go, ye
can not come.”</span> John 8:21. Heaven is a pure and
holy place. No sin will ever enter there. If we die
in our sins heaven is lost unto us forever.
</p>

<div class="tei tei-div" style="margin-bottom: 3.00em; margin-top: 3.00em">
<h3 class="tei tei-head" style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 2.40em; margin-top: 2.40em"><span style="font-size: 120%">What Is Sin?</span></h3>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Many people have become confused concerning a
sinless life because they did not understand what
sin was. A temptation or trial is not a sin, but it is
the yielding to temptation that is a sin. <span class="tei tei-q">“All unrighteousness
is sin.”</span> 1 John 5:17. All that is wrong
is sinful. There are but few people that will not
confess that we should live right in this world. To
live right in every way is the fruit of righteousness.
James says, <span class="tei tei-q">“Therefore to him that knoweth to do
good, and doeth it not, to him it is sin.”</span> 4:17. To
refuse to do a good thing known unto us when we have
opportunity is wrong and displeasing to God. Solomon
says, <span class="tei tei-q">“The thought of foolishness is sin.”</span>
<span class="tei tei-q">“In a multitude of words there wanteth not sin.”</span>
The apostle John clearly and positively defines sin
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page055">[pg 055]</span><a name="Pg055" id="Pg055" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
in these words: <span class="tei tei-q">“Whosoever committeth sin transgresseth
also the law: for sin is the transgression of
the law.”</span> 1 John 3:4.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
To transgress or violate any known law of God is
sin. This is clear and comprehensive. For instance,
a man knows it is wrong to steal, therefore if he steals
it is a sin. A man knows it is wrong to tell a falsehood,
therefore if he speaks falsely he commits a sin.
A man knows it is wrong to become intoxicated, and
yet he does become so; he has violated a known law
of right and wrong, and has therefore committed a
sin. Who is the man of common sense that does not
know it is wrong to lie, steal, swindle, defraud, curse,
drink, get angry and cross; to refuse to help a needy
neighbor when he can, to talk foolishly, to tell unseemly
tales, to backbite, slander, commit adultery, hold
enmity against another, or to be proud and vain, etc.?
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
All these, and many more, the Bible says are wrong,
and man knows them to be wrong; therefore to do
them is a sin. Sin brings man into bondage. John 8:34.
Man is unable to liberate himself from sin, but
God has sent a Deliverer. Praise his name! <span class="tei tei-q">“If the
Son therefore shall make you free, ye shall be free
indeed.”</span> John 8:36. Of this glorious deliverance we
shall speak in the following chapter.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Salvation is the song that was to be sung by the
redeemed in that day. <span class="tei tei-q">“Behold now is the day.”</span>
Our salvation has come. <span class="tei tei-q">“Glory to God in the highest,
and on earth, peace, good will toward men.”</span> Salvation
means deliverance. A prophecy concerning
the Christ—our salvation—says: <span class="tei tei-q">“He hath sent me to
bind up the broken-hearted, to proclaim liberty to
the captives, and the opening of the prison to them
that are bound.”</span> Isa. 61:1. Christ our Savior came
to deliver us from the prison-house of sin.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In the preceding chapter we learned that sin left
its crimson and scarlet stains upon the soul. Salvation
cleanses the soul, removing the stains, making
it as white as snow. Washing in <span class="tei tei-q">“niter and much
soap”</span> will not prove effectual, but the blood of Jesus
will remove every stain. Sin reproaches, but the salvation
of Jesus exalts. It lifts man up from the
coarse, degrading, shameful life of sin, and exalts
him to integrity, nobility, and purity. It removes
the discontentments, uneasiness, condemnations and
fears, and brings joy, peace and rest. Salvation
breaks the strong fetters of sin and man rejoices in
the beautiful light and liberty of this gospel day.
The scepter is wrested from the cruel tyrant, sin,
and righteousness in quietness and peace sways the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page057">[pg 057]</span><a name="Pg057" id="Pg057" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
scepter, and man rejoices. Sin is dethroned and
Christ is crowned King of glory, and his triumphant
reign is in the heart and life of man. Sin no longer
has dominion. Christ hath made us free.

the accepted time, or the time which God has accepted

dispensation of time beyond this present Christian
era in which man can be saved is Satan's falsehood

Titus 3:5, Eph. 2:5, Rom. 6:22, Jude 1, 1 Cor.

as having been received. Beyond controversy salvation
is a present attainment.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Salvation from sin is by the grace of God. The
word <span class="tei tei-q">“grace”</span> is defined by lexicographers as favor
or mercy. Grace is a characteristic in the nature of
God which offers mercy or favor though wholly unmerited
by the recipient. Man is an offender against
God. Through repentance he finds favor or grace
in God's sight without any worthiness, excellence or
meritoriousness in himself, but because of the merciful
nature of the Lord. <span class="tei tei-q">“For by grace are ye saved
through faith.”</span> Eph. 2:8. <span class="tei tei-q">“By grace ye are saved.”</span>
Ver. 5. <span class="tei tei-q">“Who hath saved us, and called us with a
holy calling, not according to our works, but according
to his own purpose and grace, which was given
us in Christ Jesus before the world began.”</span> 2 Tim.
1:9. <span class="tei tei-q">“Being justified freely by his grace.”</span> Rom.
3:24.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
If man could attain to salvation by works, then
he could plead his own merits; but we are taught that
we can only plead the mercy of God. The apostle
says that salvation is <span class="tei tei-q">“not of works, lest any man
should boast.”</span> Eph. 2:9. If it were by works man
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page059">[pg 059]</span><a name="Pg059" id="Pg059" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
would have some cause for boasting; but because it is
wholly by grace, he has nothing of self in which to
boast. Again he says, <span class="tei tei-q">“Not by works of righteousness
which we have done, but according to his mercy he
saved us, by the washing of regeneration, and renewing
of the Holy Ghost.”</span> Titus 3:5.

There is no weakness nor incompleteness in God's

Salvation is so complete that man requires no additional
cleansing or purifying to fit him for heaven.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The salvation to which the apostle had attained

There are a few texts of Scripture which teach a

of all men for my name's sake: but he that endureth

Phil. 2:12. These texts do not prove that
there is no salvation only at the end of human life,

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
We have learned that sin entered this world and
that all mankind have sinned. We have also learned
that Jesus came to save man from his sins. Now the
question may arise in the mind of some, what must I
do to be saved? We hope in this chapter to quote
such scriptures as will plainly teach you the way of
salvation, or how to be fully saved, and also the
scriptures describing each experience.
</p>

<div class="tei tei-div" style="margin-bottom: 3.00em; margin-top: 3.00em">
<h3 class="tei tei-head" style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 2.40em; margin-top: 2.40em"><span style="font-size: 120%">Repentance.</span></h3>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The first step for the sinner is to repent. When on
Pentecost men were pricked in their hearts and cried,
<span class="tei tei-q">“What shall we do?”</span> Peter answered, <span class="tei tei-q">“Repent.”</span>
It is in accordance with God's plan of redemption,
also with nature and reason, that man should repent
of his sins in order to receive pardon. Repentance
was the theme on which John preached in the wilderness
of Judea. It seems also to have been the first
subject on which the Lord preached. Mark 1:15. It
is the will of God that men should repent of their
sins. <span class="tei tei-q">“The Lord is not slack concerning his promise,
as some men count slackness; but is long-suffering
to usward, not willing that any should perish, but
that all should come to repentance.”</span> 2 Pet. 3:9.
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page064">[pg 064]</span><a name="Pg064" id="Pg064" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
It is here implied if man does not repent he shall perish.
Jesus says, <span class="tei tei-q">“Except ye repent, ye shall all likewise
perish,”</span> even as did those whose blood Pilate mingled
with their sacrifices, and those eighteen on whom
the tower of Siloam fell.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The first round in the ladder that reaches to eternal
rest is repentance. If man never takes this step
upon the way he can never reach that happy end.
Because repentance includes so much, many men
would gladly overstep this first round and begin their
Christian life on some round higher up. This they
can not do; they must take this first step, or perish.
And should they strive to climb up some other way
they are dishonest, and the Savior calls them <span class="tei tei-q">“thieves
and robbers.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
When the Pharisees and Sadducees came to the
baptism of John he said unto them, <span class="tei tei-q">“Bring forth
therefore fruits meet for repentance.”</span> Mat. 3:8.
There are fruits of repentance. The tree is known
by its fruits. When man really repents of his sins,
by his fruits or manner of life it will be made known.
One of the fruits of repentance is sorrow. We might
have said that repentance is sorrow, for <span class="tei tei-q">“godly sorrow
worketh repentance to salvation not to be repented
of; but the sorrow of the world worketh
death.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
A well known politician became an embezzler of the
county fund, and was sentenced to a few years in the
state's prison. After having received his sentence
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page065">[pg 065]</span><a name="Pg065" id="Pg065" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
he, in the sheriff's charge, passed out of the court-room,
and with tears flowing from his eyes said,
<span class="tei tei-q">“My reputation is gone forever.”</span> That was a sorrow
of the world and is not the way to salvation. Had
the tears been flowing because he had sinned against
God, who loved him, it would have been sorrow that
<span class="tei tei-q">“worketh repentance.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The apostle says in 2 Cor. 7:11, <span class="tei tei-q">“Behold this self-same
thing, that ye sorrowed after a godly sort, what
carefulness it wrought in you, yea, what clearing of
yourselves, yea, what indignation, yea, what fear, yea,
what vehement desire, yea, what zeal, yea, what revenge!”</span>
These are the fruits of repentance. The first
here mentioned is <span class="tei tei-q">“carefulness.”</span> The impenitent
lives a reckless, careless life; but a watchfulness comes
into the heart of the penitent. He becomes mindful
of his acts and carefully avoids the ways of sin. He
turns away from sin. Oh, what carefulness it works
in him. He complies with the commandment of God,
<span class="tei tei-q">“Let the wicked forsake his way.”</span> The marginal
reading of Mat. 3:8 is <span class="tei tei-q">“bring forth fruit answerable
to the amendment of life.”</span> The penitent carefully
turns away from sin, and there is therefore an amendment
of life.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The second fruit of repentance mentioned in 2
Cor. 7:11 is <span class="tei tei-q">“clearing of yourselves.”</span> Men usually
in their sinful life do many a wrong deed. When
they have a godly sorrow they are very willing to do
all they can to <span class="tei tei-q">“clear away,”</span> or right the wrongs
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page066">[pg 066]</span><a name="Pg066" id="Pg066" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
they have done. For instance, a man has in conversation
with one neighbor spoken evil of another neighbor
and injured his character. When he repents of
his sins he will acknowledge to his neighbor that he
spoke falsely, and will do what he can to repair the
injury he has done. Debts he has long neglected he
will pay when he repents of his sins, if it is possible.
Wherein he has stolen or defrauded in any way he
will restore as far as he is able. Zacchæus, when he
came down from the sycamore tree, had a penitent
heart, and said: <span class="tei tei-q">“The half of my goods I give to the
poor; and if I have taken anything from any man by
false accusation, I restore him fourfold.”</span> Luke 19:8.
God does not command a fourfold restoration, but he
does demand a restoring of an equal amount of what
has been taken. If the penitent is unable to do this
he can, no doubt, make confession, and promise to
restore as soon as possible.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It is very consistent and reasonable that God makes
such demands of the penitent. No man can rightly
object to such requirements. It establishes confidence
in the hearts of unbelievers. They see a beauty in
the Christian religion. It not only saves a man
from doing wrong deeds in his future life, but calls
upon him to repair as far as possible the wrongs and
injuries he has done in his past life. In talking about
two of the leading members of a certain religious denomination
an unbeliever recently remarked: <span class="tei tei-q">“If
these men would pay me what they owe me I would
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page067">[pg 067]</span><a name="Pg067" id="Pg067" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
have more confidence in Christianity.”</span> We saw then
how consistent it was that God requires man to correct
his past life as far as he can. It forces confidence
in the hearts of the unsaved and gains their
attention. This is the <span class="tei tei-q">“clearing of yourselves.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The penitent gladly turns away or forsakes his
evil ways. He abhors sin. Ah, what <span class="tei tei-q">“vehement desire”</span>
to be free; what zeal! He gladly does all he can
to repair the injuries he has done. When he has defrauded
man of money he will confess it and restore
it. When he has contracted debts and long neglected
them he will confess his negligence and strive to pay
them. Where he has misrepresented any one and
thereby done him an injury he will make confession.
And wherein man has wronged him and he has hatred
in his heart against him, he will freely forgive.
Jesus says, <span class="tei tei-q">“If ye forgive not men their trespasses,
neither will your Father forgive your trespasses.”</span>
Mat. 6:15.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
When the penitent has met all the requirements
of the Scriptures, and confesses all to God, he has
promised to forgive him. <span class="tei tei-q">“If we confess our sins,
he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins.”</span> 1 John
1:9. After the forsaking of sins and the restitution
of wrongs and the forgiveness of injuries, and confession
to God, there remains yet for man to

A prison-keeper inquired of Paul and Silas: <span class="tei tei-q">“Sirs,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page068">[pg 068]</span><a name="Pg068" id="Pg068" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
what must I do to be saved?”</span> And they said, <span class="tei tei-q">“Believe
on the Lord Jesus Christ and thou shalt be
saved.”</span> Acts 16:30, 31. At this point Satan has
succeeded in confusing many an honest soul. They
have forsaken all to follow Jesus, but have not that
perfect confidence that God forgives and accepts
them. Satan will allow them to believe that God will
save them in some future time, but struggles hard
to prevent their believing that Jesus saves them now.
The apostle says, <span class="tei tei-q">“By grace are ye saved through
faith.”</span> Eph. 2:8. <span class="tei tei-q">“Whosoever believeth that Jesus
is the Christ is born of God.”</span> 1 John 5:1. <span class="tei tei-q">“But as
many as received him, to them gave he power to become
the sons of God, even to them that believe on his
name.”</span> John 1:12. <span class="tei tei-q">“Therefore being justified by
faith, we have peace with God.”</span> Rom. 5:1. It is not
by enthusiasm or excitement that we are saved, but
<span class="tei tei-q">“by grace through faith.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Jesus on one occasion said, <span class="tei tei-q">“Which of you intending
to build a tower, sitteth not down first, and
counteth the cost, whether he have sufficient to finish
it.”</span> Luke 14:28. He uses this illustration to teach
us the manner in which we should come to him. The
cost is <span class="tei tei-q">“a death to sin and the world.”</span> The prize
is heaven and eternal glory. When you have carefully
counted the cost and deliberately decided in
your soul to follow Jesus, then believe on his name,
<span class="tei tei-q">“and thou shalt be saved.”</span>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The term justification is used both in the Old Testament
and the New. There is a difference between
the justification under the law and the justification by
grace. The one was obtained by the blood of animals
and the other by the blood of Jesus. Since we are
writing upon the glorious themes of the New Testament
we shall say but little of the justification by the
sacrifices of animals.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Justification implies a forgiveness of sins. The
sense of guilt resulting from a transgression of God's
law is removed. The justified therefore experience
a safety, a peace and rest. Fears and uncertainties
are banished, and the soul is filled with confidence
and hope. <span class="tei tei-q">“Therefore being justified by faith we
have peace with God.”</span> Rom. 5:1. Peace is the natural
result of justification. It is sin that destroys the happiness
of man. Before sin entered into this world
man lived in a delightful Eden. His heart was open
and frank before God, and he rejoiced in his presence.
Sin brought a sense of shame and guilt, and he hid
from the presence of God. All men admire the innocency
of childhood. The peaceful countenance of an
infant, its freedom from care, anxieties and unrest
but remind us of the peacefulness of pardon.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
There was a justification by the law, but the law
day has passed away. We have come to the gospel
day in which no flesh shall be justified by the works
of the law, but by <span class="tei tei-q">“the faith of Jesus Christ.”</span> Gal. 2:16;
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page070">[pg 070]</span><a name="Pg070" id="Pg070" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
3:11. The Bible promises nothing more in justification
than a full pardon of all transgression and
restoration to childhood innocency. <span class="tei tei-q">“And Jesus
called a little child unto him and set him in the midst
of them and said, Verily I say unto you, except ye
be converted and become as little children, ye shall
not enter into the kingdom of heaven.”</span> Mat. 18:2, 3.
A justified man is as innocent and free from transgression
as a little child. Is it not a just cause of surprise
that men will teach the forgiveness of sins necessary
to the experience of justification, and yet teach
that the justified commit sin? <span class="tei tei-q">“O Consistency, thou
art a jewel.”</span>

It occurs to our mind that if men would use consideration,
mingled with reason and judgment, they
would see the inconsistency of the above teaching.
Should a man who had used abusive language to you
come and penitently ask your forgiveness, you would
forgive, but that does not give him liberty to continue
his abuse. When the penitent comes to God he will
pardon, but this does not give him liberty to continue
in sin. God created man with an intelligence, a reason
and common sense. The ravages of sin have
greatly impaired these qualities of the mind that believes
that justification necessitates a forgiveness of
sins, yet the experience can be retained while committing
sin. A sound writer has said, <span class="tei tei-q">“Common sense is
a quality of mind not so common as the words imply.
Many claim it who have no right to its possession. It
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page071">[pg 071]</span><a name="Pg071" id="Pg071" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
is a high standard of mental worth. The brain coin
that bears its imprint has a par value wherever man is
governed by pure reason.”</span> No true Christian believes
he can live in sin and be a Christian. Even those
who are governed by pure reason do not believe such.
By the blood of Jesus <span class="tei tei-q">“all that believe are justified
from all things.”</span> Acts 13:39.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Justification by grace through faith in Jesus does
not end with a forgiveness of past transgressions only,
but includes the impartation of the divine, or eternal
life to the soul. The blood of animals offered for sins
in the Jewish economy was unable to impart this life
to the offerer of the sacrifice. Jesus says, <span class="tei tei-q">“I am
come that ye might have life.”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“Whosoever believeth
in him shall not perish, but have everlasting life.”</span>
<span class="tei tei-q">“He that hath the Son hath life, and he that hath
not the Son of God hath not life.”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“God hath given
to us eternal life, and this life is in his Son.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The process by which man enters the natural life
is termed a birth or generation. The process by
which man enters the spiritual life is expressed by the
words, <span class="tei tei-q">“being born again,”</span> or <span class="tei tei-q">“regeneration.”</span>
With the words <span class="tei tei-q">“being born again”</span> we naturally
associate life. When Nicodemus heard the words he
thought the process of bringing into physical life was
to be repeated. The Savior told him, <span class="tei tei-q">“That which is
born of the flesh is flesh; and that which is born of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page072">[pg 072]</span><a name="Pg072" id="Pg072" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the Spirit is spirit.”</span> John 3:6. In life there is activity
and power. Not only are the transgressions forgiven,
but by regeneration life and power come into
the soul, which gives man strength to resist sin. The
Israelite only hoped for a forgiveness of his past sin
through his offering. That beautiful hope of constant
victory over sin was not his to enjoy. He knew
the power of sin and the weakness of his offering;
consequently he expected naught else but to offer his
sacrifices over and over, day by day, and year by
year continually. He who to-day comes to God pleading
for forgiveness of his sins through the offering of
the eternal Son and expects to still continue in sin
enjoys no better hope than a Jew. He dishonors the
great sacrifice of God's Son by counting it no more
than the sacrifice of animals.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In regeneration the holy, pure, divine life comes
into the soul. Man passes from <span class="tei tei-q">“death unto life.”</span>
The dominion of sin has come to an end. Sin is
dethroned and its kingdom destroyed. Regenerated
man is crowned a king. The royal robes of white
enshroud him. The scepter of righteousness he
sways triumphantly and reigns a mighty conqueror,
<span class="tei tei-q">“a king and priest unto God.”</span> Praise and honor
to his name!
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This new life within man's soul finds expression
in a new life without. Since the new life within is
holy and pure the new life without is holy and pure.
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page073">[pg 073]</span><a name="Pg073" id="Pg073" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
<span class="tei tei-q">“Make the inside of the cup and platter clean and the
outside will be clean also.”</span> The apostle John tells us
the manner of life that follows <span class="tei tei-q">“being born again.”</span>
<span class="tei tei-q">“We know that whosoever is born of God sinneth
not, but he that is begotten of God keepeth himself,
and that wicked one toucheth him not.”</span> 1 John 5:18.
<span class="tei tei-q">“Whosoever is born of God doth not commit sin,
for his seed remaineth in him: and he can not sin,
because he is born of God.”</span> 1 John 3:9. This text
does not teach the impossibility of committing sin
as some have supposed, but the impossibility of committing
sin and retaining the spiritual birth. In
1 John 2:29 we are clearly taught that righteousness
of life succeeds the regeneration of man. Sin belongs
only to Satan and sinners. It is not found in the
life of God, nor of the angels, nor of Christ, nor of
the Christians.

<h3 class="tei tei-head" style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 2.40em; margin-top: 2.40em"><span style="font-size: 120%">Adoption.</span></h3>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The term <span class="tei tei-q">“adoption”</span> is a few times used in the
New Testament. It is that part of justification which
places us in the family of God. In the apostolic
days the Romans were accustomed to adopting the
children of some other family into their own. The
law on these occasions demanded a full surrender of
the child with all his possessions to his new governor
or father. The father received the child as an heir
to all his possessions, equal with his own children.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
So we in justification give ourselves to God with
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page074">[pg 074]</span><a name="Pg074" id="Pg074" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
all our talents and possessions, and he receives us
into his family, and we become joint-heirs with his
Son. This is true, and very precious because it is true.
The apostle in speaking of adoption says, <span class="tei tei-q">“For ye
have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear;
but ye have received the Spirit of adoption, whereby
we cry, Abba, Father.”</span> Rom. 8:15. We are here
taught that it is in adoption that we look upon God
as our Father. We are taught the same in Gal. 4:5,
6. By the Spirit of adoption we look unto God as
our Father and consider ourselves his own children.
As members in the family of God we yield ourselves
unto his service and <span class="tei tei-q">“our members as instruments of
righteousness unto him.”</span> This prohibits sin. To live
impure, or to commit more or less sin, and have the
yoke of Christ upon us, or to be a joint-heir with him
is indeed very disparaging.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Since the word conversion is used in connection
with justification we will give it only brief notice.
Jesus said, <span class="tei tei-q">“Except ye be converted and become as
little children,”</span> etc. Peter said, <span class="tei tei-q">“Repent and be
converted.”</span> Justification properly implies a pardon
or forgiveness of our transgressions or sins. Regeneration
implies a bringing into the spiritual life.
Adoption implies the reception of the new-born child
into the family of God. Conversion, the turning
about, or a change in life. Any one of these terms
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page075">[pg 075]</span><a name="Pg075" id="Pg075" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
include all the others. These are all accomplished
in what is known as the first work of grace, and is
most frequently and properly termed justification.

<h3 class="tei tei-head" style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 2.40em; margin-top: 2.40em"><span style="font-size: 120%">Sanctification.</span></h3>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Sanctification is one among the clear and positive
doctrines of the New Testament. Justification, regeneration,
adoption, and conversion are terms used
to signify the same work of grace, or the same experience
in the Christian life. Sanctification has reference
to a higher work of grace, or higher life. It
is an experience obtained subsequent to justification.
The Savior in praying to the Father for his
disciples said: <span class="tei tei-q">“Sanctify them through thy truth:
thy word is truth.”</span> John 17:17. Before making
this petition he told the Father of their separation
from the world and of their persecution by the world,
which are certain evidences of justification.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Sanctification is defined thus in Webster's Unabridged
Dictionary:
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
1. Sanctification is the act of God's grace by which
the affections of men are purified or alienated from
sin and the world and exalted to a supreme love of
God; also the state of being thus purified or sanctified.
2. Sanctifier. One who sanctifies or makes
holy, specially the Holy Ghost. 3. Sanctify. To set
apart to a holy or religious use; to make holy or
free from sin; to cleanse from moral corruption or
pollution; to make holy.
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page076">[pg 076]</span><a name="Pg076" id="Pg076" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Sanctification is the destruction of the body of sin
or depraved nature. The work of sanctification, or
the sanctifying process, is expressed as a cleansing or
purging or refining. It is the restoration of the soul
to its original purity or holiness by the removing of
the depraved nature incurred by the transgression in
Eden. We will conclude this subject by a Bible lesson.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
1. Sanctification is the will of God. <span class="tei tei-q">“For this is
the will of God, even your sanctification.”</span> 1 Thes.
4:3.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
2. Sanctification is effected by God. <span class="tei tei-q">“And the
very God of peace sanctify you wholly; and I pray
God your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved
blameless unto the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.”</span>
1 Thes. 5:23. <span class="tei tei-q">“Jude, the servant of Jesus Christ,
and brother of James, to them that are sanctified by
God the Father, preserved in Jesus Christ, and
called.”</span> Jude 1.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
3. Sanctification is effected by the Lord Jesus.
<span class="tei tei-q">“For both he that sanctifieth and they who are sanctified
are all of one: for which cause he is not ashamed
to call them brethren.”</span> Heb. 2:11.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
4. Sanctification is effected by the Holy Spirit.
<span class="tei tei-q">“And such were some of you: but ye are washed,
but ye are sanctified, but ye are justified in the
name of the Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of our
God.”</span> 1 Cor. 6:11.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
5. Sanctification is through the Word of God.
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page077">[pg 077]</span><a name="Pg077" id="Pg077" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
<span class="tei tei-q">“Sanctify them through thy truth: thy word is
truth.”</span> John 17:17.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
6. Sanctification is through the atonement of
Christ. <span class="tei tei-q">“Wherefore Jesus also, that he might sanctify
the people with his own blood, suffered without
the gate.”</span> Heb. 13:12.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
7. Sanctification is perfect salvation. <span class="tei tei-q">“But we are
bound to give thanks alway to God for you, brethren
beloved of the Lord, because God hath from the beginning
chosen you to salvation through sanctification
of the Spirit and belief of the truth.”</span> 2 Thes. 2:13.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
8. Sanctification as a cleansing removes spots,
wrinkles, and blemishes from the church. <span class="tei tei-q">“Husbands,
love your wives, even as Christ also loved the church,
and gave himself for it; that he might sanctify and
cleanse it with the washing of water by the word,
that he might present it to himself a glorious church,
not having spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing; but
that it should be holy and without blemish.”</span> Eph. 5:25-27.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
9. Sanctification prepares men for the service of
God. <span class="tei tei-q">“But in a great house there are not only vessels
of gold and of silver, but also of wood and of
earth; and some to honor, and some to dishonor. If
a man therefore purge himself from these, he shall
be a vessel unto honor, sanctified, and meet for the
Master's use, and prepared unto every good work.”</span>
2 Tim. 2:20, 21.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Because this text is very generally misunderstood
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page078">[pg 078]</span><a name="Pg078" id="Pg078" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
we feel like giving an explanation of it. It was long
misunderstood by us. Only very recently the Holy
Spirit interpreted it to our heart. One evening we
asked God to give us an understanding of this difficult
passage of Scripture, and the next morning we
fully understood it. It is very simple. In a great
house there are vessels of gold and silver, wood and
earth, some to honor and some to dishonor. This
house represents man in his natural state. There are
some good traits of character in most every unregenerated
man, and also some evil traits. He has some
honorable dispositions and some dishonorable. Full
salvation, which includes both justification and sanctification,
will save and purge him from every dishonorable
inclination and evil trait of character, and fit
him for the Master's use. He will be used only to the
glory of God. All his fruits will be holy unto the
Lord.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
10. Sanctification prepares man for heaven. We
have quoted from 1 Cor. 6:11. By reading the two
preceding verses we learn that sanctification is necessary
to the entrance of heaven.

<h3 class="tei tei-head" style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 2.40em; margin-top: 2.40em"><span style="font-size: 120%">Holiness.</span></h3>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
There is a sweet melody in the word <span class="tei tei-q">“holiness.”</span>
We associate it with everything that is heavenly. It
is frequently used synonymously with sanctification,
yet not always with all the forms of the word sanctification.
On the whole there is a slight difference
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page079">[pg 079]</span><a name="Pg079" id="Pg079" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
in the meaning of the two terms. Holiness is the
consummation of the work of sanctification. By
transposing a few words in Heb. 12:14 we would have
it read, <span class="tei tei-q">“Without holiness no man shall see the Lord.”</span>
Holiness is here a noun objective to the preposition
without. In some translations this sentence would
read, <span class="tei tei-q">“Without sanctification no man shall see the
Lord.”</span> Sanctification is here a noun, the object of
the preposition without. As nouns these words are
used interchangeably.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In Jude, first verse, we have this sentence, <span class="tei tei-q">“To them
that are sanctified by God the Father.”</span> The word
<span class="tei tei-q">“sanctified”</span> is here used as a predicate adjective, and
describes the people addressed. It would not alter
the meaning of the text were we to translate it thus:
<span class="tei tei-q">“To them that are made holy by God the Father.”</span>
The word holy is here used as a predicate adjective,
and describes the people addressed. In the sentence,
<span class="tei tei-q">“Sanctify them through thy truth”</span> (John 17:17),
the word <span class="tei tei-q">“sanctify”</span> is a verb, denoting action, of
which we have no form of the word holiness. The
word holiness can not be used as a verb. The word
sanctification frequently expresses action; the word
holiness never. They are synonymous when they express
the pure state of man. Sanctification is the
act that brings man into a holy state, which is also
the sanctified state. Sanctification may be applied to
the holy state, and also to the action that brings us
into that state. Since the word sanctification contains
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page080">[pg 080]</span><a name="Pg080" id="Pg080" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
action it is positive proof there is a cleansing in
it.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Now we desire by a few Scriptural texts and a few
suggestions to deepen the reader's conception of the
state of holiness. Everything in the realm of Christianity,
or the kingdom of God, from heaven to earth
is holy. Let us here give you a brief Bible lesson,
kindly asking you to carefully read each text.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
1. God is holy. <span class="tei tei-q">“In the year that king Uzziah died
I saw also the Lord sitting upon a throne, high and
lifted up, and his train filled the temple. Above it
stood the seraphims: each one had six wings; with
twain he covered his face, and with twain he covered
his feet, and with twain he did fly. And one cried
unto another, and said, Holy, holy, holy, is the Lord
of hosts: the whole earth is full of his glory.”</span> Isa.
6:1-3.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
If the reader here obtains a just conception of the
holy character of God it will give him an understanding
of the true nature of Christianity and the manner
of life of a Christian. A gentleman once asked me
if it was wrong or unbecoming to a Christian to attend
the present day street carnivals. We replied in
about these words: <span class="tei tei-q">“If you gain a true conception of
the holiness of the Almighty you will not need to
ask me such a question.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
2. Heaven is holy. <span class="tei tei-q">“Now know I that the Lord

Let us repeat: God is holy; heaven is holy; the
angels are holy; Christ is holy; the Spirit is holy;
God's Word is holy; the way to heaven is holy.
Reader, we want you to picture before you a holy
heaven and the holy way that leads to heaven. Read
this text: <span class="tei tei-q">“Follow peace with all men, and holiness
without which no man shall see the Lord.”</span> Heb.
12:14.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Looking into the Word of the Lord we find that
man was chosen to holiness. Eph. 1:4. That God
calls him to holiness. 1 Thes. 4:7. That God designed
that man should serve him in holiness. Luke 1:75.
That God chastens man in order that he might be partaker
of his holiness. Heb. 12:10. That God purposes
that man shall be saved from his sin and bear fruit
unto holiness. Rom. 6:22. That God commands him to
be holy in all manner of conduct. 2 Pet. 3:11. God
commands him to be holy because he is holy. 1 Pet.
1:15, 16. Looking unto God's great and holy plan in
redeeming man, and the holiness of heaven, and God
sitting on his holy throne, and Christ the Holy One
at his right hand, and the holy angels shouting praises,
how can you entertain a hope of ever entering
that glorious land without holiness?

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Many have stumbled at the command to be perfect.
That finite man may be perfect in this sinful world
sounds ridiculous to many unregenerated hearts.
This is because they do not understand God nor his
power to deliver man from sin. With the many exhortations
and commands to perfection contained in
the Holy Scriptures is it not singular that man will
yet say, <span class="tei tei-q">“We can not be perfect in this life”</span>? Many
people who oppose the doctrine of Christian perfection
do not at all understand it. They consider it
to be an end of all growth, consequently they do not
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page084">[pg 084]</span><a name="Pg084" id="Pg084" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
understand its nature. There is a perfection of
celestial beings not to be experienced by mortal man;
but there is a perfection unmistakably taught in the
Scriptures which Christians are privileged to experience
and enjoy in this life.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Christian perfection relates to right desires and
actions and purity of affections. Paul in closing his
epistle to the church at Corinth says: <span class="tei tei-q">“Finally, brethren,
farewell. Be perfect, be of good comfort, be
of one mind, live in peace; and the God of love and
peace shall be with you.”</span> Surely every one must
concede that there is a perfection to which Christians
can attain. When Christians are exhorted to be perfect
is it not folly to say, <span class="tei tei-q">“They can not be perfect”</span>?
Could we not with equal propriety say, <span class="tei tei-q">“We can not
be of good comfort”</span>? <span class="tei tei-q">“We can not live in peace”</span>?
<span class="tei tei-q">“The God of love and peace will not be with us”</span>? etc.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The apostle in writing to the Philippian brethren
uses language which clearly implies that some of them
had attained to the experience of perfection. He
says, <span class="tei tei-q">“Let us therefore, as many as be perfect, be thus
minded.”</span> Phil. 3:15. Some of them certainly were
perfect. In verse twelve he does speak of a perfection
to which he had not attained. This he expected to attain
in the glory world. Christian perfection is a
life that accords with the Holy Scriptures. Whosoever
receives the correction, and reproving and the
instructions in righteousness contained in the Scripture
will become a perfect Christian. 2 Tim. 3:16.
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page085">[pg 085]</span><a name="Pg085" id="Pg085" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Whosoever lives as the Word of God says that Christians
should live, the same is a perfect man. Paul
prays that God would make the Hebrews perfect.
Heb. 13:20, 21. Peter petitions the God of all grace,
who hath called us unto his eternal glory by Christ
Jesus, after we have suffered a while to make us perfect,
stablish, strengthen, settle us. 1 Pet. 5:10.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Jesus was made perfect through suffering. God
chastens us that we might be partakers of his holiness.
The gold and silver to be made pure and
perfect must be refined in the crucible. We to reflect
the beauty and glory of God must, too, pass through
the refiner's fire. The apostle Paul in writing his
first epistle to the church at Corinth says: <span class="tei tei-q">“Howbeit
we speak wisdom among them that are perfect.”</span> 2:6.
Certainly there were perfect Christians in the church
at that place. To the Ephesian brethren he says that
God <span class="tei tei-q">“gave some, apostles; and some prophets; and
some evangelists; and some, pastors and teachers; for
the perfecting of the saints.”</span> 4:11, 12. Now we at
once know that this work of instruction and perfection
is to be accomplished in this life.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
He further says, <span class="tei tei-q">“Till we all come in the unity
of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God,
unto a perfect man, unto the measure of the stature
of the fulness of Christ.”</span> Ver. 13. By stature is
meant the height of any one. Christ is the stature or
height of perfection, and we are to measure up to it.
This accords with what the Savior himself said:
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page086">[pg 086]</span><a name="Pg086" id="Pg086" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
<span class="tei tei-q">“The disciple is not above his master: but every one
that is perfect shall be as his master.”</span> Luke 6:40.
To the church at Colosse the apostle says: <span class="tei tei-q">“Whom
[Christ] we preach, warning every man, and teaching
every man in all wisdom; that we may present every
man perfect in Christ Jesus.”</span> Col. 1:28. Again he
says, <span class="tei tei-q">“Epaphras who is one of you, a servant of
Christ, saluteth you, always laboring fervently for
you in prayers, that ye may stand perfect and complete
in all the will of God.”</span> 4:12.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
As we have before said, There is a perfection only
attainable after the resurrection, but there is a perfection
attainable in this life, and it is the nature of
this perfection that we wish to understand. It is
holiness of nature, right desires and actions and purity
of affections toward God and man. It implies an entire
consecration to God. A young man came to Jesus
inquiring what he should do to inherit eternal
life. Jesus said unto him, <span class="tei tei-q">“If thou wilt be perfect,
go and sell that thou hast, and give to the poor, and
thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come and
follow me.”</span> Mat. 19:21. This teaches a resignation
of all to God, which is necessary that we might
be refined and polished to such a brilliancy that will
make us a light in the world. Christians are termed
jewels in the Scriptures. <span class="tei tei-q">“And they shall be mine,
saith the Lord of hosts, in that day when I make up
my jewels.”</span>

Christian perfection includes soundness and inoffensiveness
of speech. <span class="tei tei-q">“If any man offend not in
word, the same is a perfect man, and able also to
bridle the whole body.”</span> Jas. 3:2. We consider this
a very strong text, and an abundance of grace is required
to enable us to perfectly fulfil it.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father
which is in heaven is perfect.”</span> Mat. 5:48. The perfection
which God designs that Christians shall have
equal with his own relates to the purity of his nature
and affection. In the immediate preceding verses the
Savior commands Christians to love their enemies,
bless them that curse them, do good to them that
hate them, and pray for them which despitefully use
them and persecute them. As Christians this is our
nature. We will not <span class="tei tei-q">“render evil for evil.”</span> We will
befriend our persecutors, feed our enemy when he
hungers, and give him drink when he thirsts. In
verse forty-five the Savior tells us of the Father's behavior
toward his enemies: <span class="tei tei-q">“He maketh his sun to
rise on the evil and on the good, and sendeth rain
on the just and on the unjust.”</span> Here we behold
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page088">[pg 088]</span><a name="Pg088" id="Pg088" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the merciful nature of God and how he does good
for evil. If we love only those who love us and do
good only to those who do good to us (ver. 46, 47) we
are not in the nature of God; we are no more than
publicans and sinners. But if we love our enemies
and do good to those who hate us, we are reflecting
the character of God. In this respect he would have
us to be <span class="tei tei-q">“perfect, even as he is perfect.”</span> O beloved,
see that you entertain right feelings toward all men.
Do good to your enemies; love them, pray for them,
and convince them that you are more than the ordinary
sinful man, and God will bless you now and
eternally.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In the parable of the sower and its explanation
the Savior said the seed which fell among thorns are
they which hear the word and go forth and are choked
by the cares and riches and pleasures of life, and
bring no fruit to perfection. Luke 8:14. Christian
fruit is loving our enemies, doing them good, doing
good unto all men, speaking evil of none, manifesting
love, faith, meekness, gentleness, joy, etc. This
is Christian fruit, and may God help every reader
to bring it forth to the highest degree of perfection.

They are spoken of as being clothed in white and
having countenances shining as the light. Mat. 28:3;
Mark 16:5; John 20:12; Acts 1:9, 10. White is
an emblem of purity. These transient visitors from

Pure thoughts. <span class="tei tei-q">“Finally, brethren, whatsoever

whatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever things are
of good report; if there be any virtue, and if there

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This is one of the terms used in the Scriptures
describing the character of God and his people. <span class="tei tei-q">“The
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page092">[pg 092]</span><a name="Pg092" id="Pg092" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Lord is righteous,”</span> and the source of all righteousness.
Man can not possess righteousness independent
of God. It is beautiful to contemplate the righteous
character of the Almighty as revealed in the holy
Scriptures. It enables us to better understand our
own nature when we are <span class="tei tei-q">“filled with all the fulness
of God.”</span> The Savior in his prayer addresses God
as <span class="tei tei-q">“righteous Father.”</span> John 17:25. The Revelator
in his vision heard an angel proclaiming, <span class="tei tei-q">“Thou
art righteous, O Lord.”</span> Rev. 16:5. The Psalmist
in exalting the righteousness of the Lord said: <span class="tei tei-q">“Thy
righteousness also, O God, is very high.”</span> Psa. 71:19.
It is far above the ways and life of natural man:
<span class="tei tei-q">“For as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are
my ways higher than your ways, and my thoughts
than your thoughts.”</span> Isa. 55:9. All of God's ways
are in righteousness: <span class="tei tei-q">“The Lord is righteous in all
his ways.”</span> Psa. 145:17. God's acts are done in
righteousness: <span class="tei tei-q">“Now therefore stand still, that I may
reason with you before the Lord of all the righteous
acts of the Lord which he did to you and your
fathers.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Oh, the sublimity of the righteous character of
God! How lofty and high. How far above the ways
and acts of natural man. Man in his natural state
does not possess any of the righteous principles of
God: <span class="tei tei-q">“There is none righteous, no not one.”</span> But
God in the incarnation of his Son is both God and
man, and through this means the righteousness of God
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page093">[pg 093]</span><a name="Pg093" id="Pg093" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
is delegated unto man. In Jesus Christ we have the
combining of man and God—the righteousness of
God and humanity of man. Through the death of
the man Christ Jesus and his resurrection the way
was prepared for mankind to receive the righteousness
of God. <span class="tei tei-q">“For he hath made him to be sin for
us, who knew no sin: that we might be made the
righteousness of God in him.”</span> 2 Cor. 5:21. Jesus
in his innocency and righteousness bore the sins of
the guilty, so that in him we can experience a cleansing
<span class="tei tei-q">“from all unrighteousness”</span> and receive instead
<span class="tei tei-q">“the righteousness of God.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Jesus likens himself and his people to a vine and
its branches. He says, <span class="tei tei-q">“I am the vine, ye are the
branches.”</span> It is through the vine that the branches
receive substance and strength and life from the soil.
It is through Jesus that we receive righteousness,
grace, and strength from God. It is only in Jesus'
name that we receive anything from the Father.
The branches bear the fruit. Receiving the righteousness
of God through Jesus we bear the fruit of righteousness.
The more of this fruit we bear the more we
show forth the praise of God. When there is a
large yield of grain we conclude it was sown in good
soil, and thus the soil gets the praise. We <span class="tei tei-q">“being
filled with the fruits of righteousness which are by
Jesus Christ”</span> do show forth <span class="tei tei-q">“the glory and praise
of God.”</span> Phil. 1:11. <span class="tei tei-q">“Herein is my Father glorified,
that ye bear much fruit.”</span> John 15:8. Though the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page094">[pg 094]</span><a name="Pg094" id="Pg094" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
grain be planted in good soil, cultivation is necessary
to a bountiful harvest. Though we be planted in
Christ cultivation is necessary to the production of
rich fruit. <span class="tei tei-q">“And every branch that beareth fruit,
he purgeth it, that it may bring forth more fruit.”</span>
John 15:2. Sin—all sin must be purged or cleansed
away in order to bear fruits of righteousness.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“A tree is known by its fruits.”</span> Should there be a
tree bearing promiscuously throughout apples, pears,
peaches, plums, grapes, etc., who could tell what kind
of a tree it was? Should it bear apples alone we at
once know the kind of tree. All sin is therefore
purged away from the heart of a Christian that he
may be <span class="tei tei-q">“filled with the fruits of righteousness,”</span> and
be known as a light in the world. Sin and righteousness
do not grow upon the same tree. How clearly
and plainly this is taught in the sixth chapter of
Romans. Except they be blinded by prejudice and
false teaching all the world must understand this.
Verse eighteen says, <span class="tei tei-q">“Being then made free from sin,
ye became the servants of righteousness.”</span> There are
two things plainly taught in this text that we wish
to call your attention to. First, to become a servant
of righteousness necessitates a freedom from sin.
<span class="tei tei-q">“Ye can not serve two masters.”</span> Second, this experience
of being made free from sin and becoming
servants of righteousness the Roman brethren had
received some time in the past. <span class="tei tei-q">“Ye became the
servants of righteousness.”</span> Ver. 20. <span class="tei tei-q">“For when
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page095">[pg 095]</span><a name="Pg095" id="Pg095" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
some time in their past life ye were the servants
of sin ye were free from righteousness.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In the face of these two texts how can man be
so daring and proud and self-conceited as to teach
the impossibility of Christians living a pure and
sinless life in this world? Surely, there is no fear of
God before their eyes. Verse eighteen declares that
to become servants of righteousness necessitates freedom
from sin; and verse twenty declares that to be
a <span class="tei tei-q">“servant of sin”</span> necessitates freedom from righteousness.
<span class="tei tei-q">“What fruit had ye then in those things
whereof ye are now ashamed?”</span> Ver. 21. Of the
things of sin they once engaged in they are now
ashamed. <span class="tei tei-q">“What fruit had they then?”</span> Ans.—<span class="tei tei-q">“No
fruit of righteousness.”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“But now being made free
from sin, and become servants to God, ye have your
fruit unto holiness.”</span> Ver. 22. Praise God! You
must be made free from sin to be capable of bearing
fruit unto holiness or righteousness. The fruit
of the righteous is to the praise and glory of God.
The Lord makes use of the fruit of the righteous to
induce sinners to seek him. In this way the fruit
of the righteous is a tree of life. How blessed and
noble to be a tree planted by the river of waters
richly laden with righteous fruit. Amen.

with God. Because of transgression on the part
of man this natural agreement between God and man
was destroyed. All creation—herb, and tree, beast
and fowl, and man—was pronounced very good by
the Creator as he beheld it in review after creation.
Gen. 1:29-31.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But because of Eden's sin the very nature of all
things became changed. The ground became cursed,
and thorns and thistles sprang up. Gen. 3:17, 18.
The nature of the beast creation, no doubt, became
affected by man's transgression. Gen. 6:7, 11-13.
The transgression in Eden was the entrance of sin
into this world. Rom. 5:12. Previous to this, all in
the world was sinless harmony, and the earth itself
uncursed by thorns and thistles. By the entrance
of sin man's nature became changed, and since the
nature of man became depraved there has not been
a single individual born of the flesh but has possessed
a depraved nature, except the child conceived by
the Holy Spirit. The Psalmist says: <span class="tei tei-q">“Behold, I was
shapen in iniquity, and in sin did my mother conceive
me.”</span> Psa. 51:5.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This same is true of every child. The nature of
the child in its formation in the womb is depraved.
The moral condition of the parents may modify to
an extent, but never wholly change that nature. The
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page097">[pg 097]</span><a name="Pg097" id="Pg097" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
child does not inherit a depraved nature from its
parents. It is not because the parents are depraved
that the child is conceived in sin, but because nature
is depraved. It required a supernatural conception
to beget a pure child, everything in nature being depraved.
The child does not inherit either physical
or moral image directly from its parents. It is
true, the child generally bears a marked resemblance
to the parent, both physically and morally, but on
the whole it is born in the image of Adam, morally
and physically. It is generally the case that if a
parent have three arms, or possess but one, his offspring
will have two, receiving its physical image
from the first created man. Should the parents be
holy, the child will possess a carnal nature, because
it is the nature of all the race.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
How holy parents beget children depraved in nature
is a puzzling problem to some minds, especially
to those who are busying themselves about the intricate
matters of God. This need be no more puzzling
than a deformed parent begetting perfectly
formed children. Nature, in embryo, begins its work
of forming both the physical and moral image of
the child, which is after the similitude of the original
parents and not the immediate ones. While justification,
which is the forgiveness of actual transgression,
the inevitable result of a depraved nature, is a wonderful
and glorious achievement of grace, it is but
a very small part of the redemption of Christ. The
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page098">[pg 098]</span><a name="Pg098" id="Pg098" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
supernatural overthrow of the depraved nature by
the power of the Holy Spirit is the principal and
real redemptive work. The pardon of committed
sins is the clearing away of the rubbish, or preparation
work, for the Third Person in the Holy Trinity to
effect a revolution in the nature of man. Halleluiah
to God! This change in nature is more wonderful
than the revolting of nature at the command of
Joshua. Man now, instead of being depraved in nature,
is restored to his original holy nature.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This destruction of the carnal nature and the restoration
of the original nature is accomplished by the
Holy Spirit at the moment of his reception as an indwelling
Comforter. Peter teaches this truth when
he says: <span class="tei tei-q">“God, which knoweth the hearts [or nature],
bare them witness, giving them the Holy
Ghost, even as he did unto us [at Pentecost]; and put
no difference between us and them [Gentiles], purifying
their hearts by faith.”</span> Acts 15:8, 9. Purifying
the heart is the purification of man's affections,
or nature. This is accomplished at the time of the
giving of the Holy Ghost as declared in the last
text; and this purifying of the hearts of the Gentiles
at the giving of the Holy Ghost, is just what was
done for the apostles at Pentecost. This is a plain,
undeniable fact taught in this text. To turn to
philosophizing upon how we can be conceived with a
carnal nature, or how we can be converted and yet be
depraved in nature is to soon become spoiled through
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page099">[pg 099]</span><a name="Pg099" id="Pg099" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
vain deceit after the rudiments of the world and
not after Christ. Col. 2:8. In the very nature
of things, and according to the Word of God, pardon
of sins necessarily precedes the destruction of the
carnal, depraved nature by the Holy Spirit. In the
fall of man there was the act of transgression and
also a change in man's moral image. In his restoration
there must be a pardon of transgression and
subsequently a change in nature.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It is a law of God that the redemption of man
be accomplished through faith, by his grace. Our
faith can not reach beyond our knowledge. By
knowledge we mean a real soul-consciousness or conviction
and not an intellectual knowledge. At this
point many a dear soul has erred from the truth.
They have endeavored to bring their faith up to
their intellectual knowledge, which ends in presumption.
True Bible faith is grounded in the soul. It results
from a soul-knowledge, or conviction. To accept
pardon of sins or healing of the body with only an
intellectual knowledge of these blessings and not a
real heart-conviction is mere presumption, and ends
in failure and disgrace. To follow the comprehensions
of the intellect, and not the enlightenment of
the Holy Spirit upon the soul, concerning the mysteries
of God's salvation is to be led into error, because
the intellect can not fathom the things of God.
We do now emphatically say, according to God's established
law, that no unregenerated heart can have
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page100">[pg 100]</span><a name="Pg100" id="Pg100" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
a comprehension or conviction of a corrupt moral
nature and its purification. Why? Because transgression
stands between it and purity. The awakened
guilty soul knows nothing but its guilt, and for forgiveness
only does it plead. After being pardoned, the
soul gains a knowledge of carnality, and it is
then convicted for the second cleansing.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Those who believe that purity of heart is attained
in pardon take as a basis of such belief the language
of Paul in 2 Cor. 5:17; Rom. 8:1-7; and similar
texts. Now the apostle often speaks of full salvation,
or complete redemption of the soul, in a general
way. He says that <span class="tei tei-q">“salvation is by the grace of
God through faith.”</span> By this he does not mean justification
only, but sanctification as well. He has
not specified the two works, but has spoken of full
salvation in a general way of being by grace through
faith. Thus Eph. 2:8-10 includes full salvation.
In 2 Cor. 5:17 he again speaks of full salvation in
a general way. It is true we are in Christ when
converted, but we are none the less in him when
sanctified. To say that Paul is referring to the justified
only in this text is an error. By the two preceding
verses we have reason to believe he is referring
to those who are wholly sanctified. This
then is no proof text that carnality is destroyed in
justification, because you can not prove that he is
referring to those who are only justified. In conclusion
we would say that Christ came to redeem
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page101">[pg 101]</span><a name="Pg101" id="Pg101" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
man only. Beast and bird have no part in the redemption.
They shall perish. The earth is not redeemable,
but being under the curse—spotted by sin—it
shall be destroyed.

Men are likened unto trees in some Scriptural texts.
The righteous are termed good trees, and the wicked
evil trees. Now the <span class="tei tei-q">“tree is known by its fruit.”</span>
The fruits of the flesh are borne upon the evil tree,
while the fruits of the Spirit are borne upon the good
tree. The fruits of the Spirit are enumerated in
Gal. 5:22, 23: <span class="tei tei-q">“But the fruit of the Spirit is love,
joy, peace, long-suffering, gentleness, goodness, faith,
meekness, temperance: against such there is no law.”</span>
We shall describe these fruits separately by the word

<h4 class="tei tei-head" style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 2.00em; margin-top: 2.00em">Love.</h4>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This is the sweetest theme in the Scriptures and
the greatest thing in earth or heaven. <span class="tei tei-q">“God is love,”</span>
and because he is love he sought to rescue, through
the sacrifice of his Son, his fallen creatures. It was
love that prompted God to make so great a sacrifice
for man. It is love that prompts man to sacrifice all
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page102">[pg 102]</span><a name="Pg102" id="Pg102" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
for God. When man loves God he loves everything
in God's creation. No man can love God and hate his
brother; no man can love God and hate his enemies.
God loves his enemies. It is the nature of the love of
God. When man possesses the love of God in his heart
he will love his enemies. To love those who love us
and despise those who despise us, is not a love that is
a fruit of the Spirit. When man possesses the love
of God he does not love the world. 1 John 2:15-17.
Everything in our service to God if acceptable must
be actuated by love. Supernatural gifts are nothing
without love. 1 Cor. 13:1, 2. The greatest deeds
of sacrifice profit us nothing without they are done
in love. Ver. 3. In the following verses of this
chapter the nature of love is beautifully and obviously
portrayed.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
1. Charity suffereth long. By long-suffering is
meant to patiently bear with the failings and foibles
of our brother, <span class="tei tei-q">“With all lowliness and meekness,
with long-suffering, forbearing one another in
love.”</span> Eph. 4:2. There is a beautiful thought in
1 Tim. 1:16. That Jesus might show his long-suffering
through us as a pattern for all who may in any
way know of our life.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
2. Charity is kind. Where love is there is kindness.
The greater the love the greater the kindness. The
lioness in all the fierceness of her nature strokes her
whelp in tenderness and kindness. Thus kindness is
a product of love. Love will put a tenderness in our
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page103">[pg 103]</span><a name="Pg103" id="Pg103" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
looks, a gentleness in our speech, and a kindness in
our acts. If you are not as kind as you know you
should be, seek God for more of his love.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
3. Charity envieth not. How impossible to envy
those we love. The more fortunate they are the more
we rejoice. The more they are praised and honored
the deeper is our joy. With those we love, we weep
when they weep and rejoice when they rejoice. If
there is a secret envy in your heart because of the
praise and prosperity of others, the love of God is
wanting. <span class="tei tei-q">“Let not thine heart envy sinners.”</span> Prov.
23:17.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
4. Charity vaunteth not itself. We can only love
God at the sacrifice of all self-love. When man possesses
the love of God there is no self-praise, nor seeking
of honor; there is no setting self forward, but the
lowliest seat is the most desirable.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
5. Charity is not puffed up. There are no feelings
of self-importance in the heart when the love of God
is abounding. We love him so devotedly we desire
him to receive all the praise. Should God make some
use of you it will be natural to give him all the praise.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
6. Charity doth not behave itself unseemly. There
is a becomingness in all the actions of pure and holy
love. There is a beautiful consistency in the worship
of God when all is actuated by pure love. There is
nothing unseemly in our behavior toward God or our
fellow man, even to the most cultured minds, when
influenced by love. It is noble and sublime, elevating
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page104">[pg 104]</span><a name="Pg104" id="Pg104" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
and pleasing to pure hearts. Praise is comely when
flowing from a heart full of love, but a wild hurrahing
is unseemly. All unseemly conduct in modes and
forms of worship—such as tossing the head to and fro,
swaying the body, the loud stamping of feet, rolling
on the floor, lying stiff and rigid, shouting until the
face reddens and veins distend and exhaustion overcomes,
are disgracing to God and disgusting to refined
ears and pure hearts.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
7. Charity seeketh not her own. When man possesses
the love of God he does not seek his own pleasure
and happiness but is interested in the welfare and
happiness of others; <span class="tei tei-q">“He looks not upon his own
things but upon the things of others.”</span> We seek opportunities
to do good to those we love.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
8. Charity is not easily provoked. There is a
weightiness in the love of God. It balances all our
actions. We are not hasty under provocations; we
are not excited or vexed at every trivial occurrence.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
9. Charity thinketh no evil. The meditations of
a heart of pure love are holy. A holy man's thoughts
are upon pure and true subjects. He thinketh no
evil.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
10. Charity rejoiceth not in iniquity. Sin saddens
and grieves the heart of love. Should there be a secret
rejoicing in your heart because some brother
has fallen into sin, you are proud and an abomination
unto God.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
11. Charity rejoiceth in the truth. Where the truth
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page105">[pg 105]</span><a name="Pg105" id="Pg105" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
is accepted it causes the heart of love to rejoice.
Should God use some other individual in setting the
truth before people which causes them to rejoice, if
you love God and the truth you will rejoice with
them.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
12. Charity beareth all things. Amid adversities,
afflictions, persecutions, temptations and trials, when
storms gather, and breakers threaten, when friends
prove false, and the way grows weary, love looks
trustingly up to God and says, <span class="tei tei-q">“Thou doeth all things
well, blessed be thy name.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
13. Charity believeth all things. Those who love
are ever ready to believe the best of everything and
everybody. They see all the good qualities of man
before they see his faults. They are ready to believe
all the good they hear of any one and slow to believe
evil. They rejoice to put confidence in man, and when
man's evil ways break that confidence they still hope
for something good.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
14. Charity hopeth all things. It is very difficult
to discourage the heart that is full of love. When love
waxes cold then disappointments may cause a murmur.
Love hopes for the very best outcome for good
of everything.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
15. Charity endureth all things. The same might be
said of this as that <span class="tei tei-q">“charity beareth all things.”</span>
Whatever darkness may arise to-day, Love hopes for
sunshine to-morrow and patiently endures.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
16. Charity never fails. Thank God! Pretended
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page106">[pg 106]</span><a name="Pg106" id="Pg106" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
friends may fail you; the world may fail you;
wealth and honor may fail you; but love will never
fail. It will bear you over the rough places in life's
pathway. It will drive away the clouds. It will kiss
the chastening rod. It will sweeten the bitter cup.
It will soften the hardest pillow, and when you are
brought down into the shadow of death Love looks
across to the golden glories and sings as the cords are
being severed—Love never fails.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Since we have given an exposition of the fruits of
a Christian, which have their origin in heaven, as
expressed by the apostle, we deem it necessary to
set before the reader in a true Bible light the
fruits of the flesh, which have their origin in an evil
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page110">[pg 110]</span><a name="Pg110" id="Pg110" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
nature. While we are aware that many are deceived
as to their spiritual condition, as saith the Scriptures,
yet none need to be. The Word of God so carefully
enumerates the fruits of a Christian heart and the
fruits of an evil heart, that all may know by impartial
examination what manner of tree they are. <span class="tei tei-q">“The
tree is known by his fruits.”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“Know thyself.”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“Now
the works of the flesh are manifest, which are these;
adultery, fornication, uncleanness, lasciviousness, idolatry,
witchcraft, hatred, variance, emulation, wrath,
strife, seditions, heresies, envyings, murders, drunkenness,
revelings, and such like: of the which I tell you
before, as I have also told you in time past, that
they which do such things shall not inherit the kingdom
of God.”</span> Gal. 5:19-21.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
1. Adultery and fornication. <span class="tei tei-q">“But I say unto
you, That whosoever looketh on a woman to lust after
her hath committed adultery with her already in
his heart.”</span> Mat. 5:28. <span class="tei tei-q">“Whosoever putteth away
his wife, and marrieth another, committeth adultery:
and whosoever marrieth her that is put away from her
husband committeth adultery.”</span> Luke 16:18. This is
clear and plain language and all can understand it
without comment.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
2. Uncleanness. This may include filthy habits,
but especially impure thoughts and conversation, unholy
practises and desires.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
5. Witchcraft. Enchantments and spells, such as
healing by hypnotism, and sciences. Omens, signs

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
6. Hatred. A feeling of ill-will against any one
or anything. <span class="tei tei-q">“Whosoever hateth his brother is a
murderer.”</span> 1 John 3:15. Feelings of hatred are opposed
to feelings of love.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
7. Variance. When hatred in the hearts of two individuals
develops into open acts, it is variance.

8. Emulation. This is a disposition to strive to
excel others, even at their expense—exaltedness.

You will notice that the fruits of the flesh are directly
opposed to the fruits of the Spirit. By careful
and prayerful study of this catalogue of evil
fruits and an examination of your actions, thoughts,
and inclinations, you can unmistakably know whether
you are prepared or not for heaven. Make your calling
and election sure. Never be contented if there
is any fruit in your life of the nature of the above.
I have been asked the question, <span class="tei tei-q">“Will a Christian
ever attend the present day church entertainments?”</span>
A Christian, largely ignorant of the vast separation
from the world salvation makes, may, through the
persuasion of friends, or some other similar cause,
attend such a place of revelry, but he will not enjoy
the hour. He will be uneasy and long for the last
act that he may get away to commune with God.
Whoever has a heart to enter into such worldliness
with enjoyment has a heart unfit for heaven. He is
not a Christian.

<h4 class="tei tei-head" style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 2.00em; margin-top: 2.00em">Two Works Of Grace.</h4>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Many treat with scorn the doctrine of <span class="tei tei-q">“two works
of grace,”</span> but that can never make it unscriptural.
It is very unwise to disbelieve a truth merely because
we have been taught and always believed to the contrary.
An early education has a great influence upon
the mind. Through the teachings of a relative we
embraced an error in our youth. In after years
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page113">[pg 113]</span><a name="Pg113" id="Pg113" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
when the subject was read and thought upon it was
difficult to comprehend and believe the plain truths of
history. It is wisdom therefore to always carefully
and prayerfully examine a doctrine before condemning
and rejecting it. <span class="tei tei-q">“Why does not God fully redeem
the soul in one instantaneous work of grace?”</span>
many ask. What right have we to question God concerning
his plan of redemption? Was not the whole
scheme in his hand? What part has man performed
in the arrangement of the affair? Then why should he
question? It only remains for us to humbly bow our
hearts and accept the plan as God has devised it,
else we can never have a part in it.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Why did God require Naaman to dip seven times
in Jordan? Why did Jesus put his hands the second
time upon the blind man of Bethsaida before he
saw clearly? Why does God redeem a soul by two
works of grace? These questions are equally absurd.
But you say, God does the thing most reasonable.
That he does, and redemption by two works of grace
is the very most reasonable and natural way to restore
the soul to its normal condition. Man was holy
in his nature in creation. By sin he became possessed
of an evil nature. The Psalmist says, <span class="tei tei-q">“I was shapen
in iniquity; and in sin did my mother conceive me.”</span>
Psa. 51:5. The apostle declares he was by nature a
child of wrath. Eph. 2:3. Other texts could be
quoted, but these together with the knowledge of a
child's disposition is sufficient to convince any candid
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page114">[pg 114]</span><a name="Pg114" id="Pg114" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
mind. Children naturally learn evil things, while
good traits more often have to be forced upon them
by training. It comes natural for them to get angry,
to be selfish, to tell falsehoods, to fight, to be proud,
etc.; not in all to the same degree, but such disposition
is largely predominant in the generality of children,
and exists to a certain degree in all.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Children are not responsible for this evil nature as
we have previously spoken. They are not responsible
for their wrong acts, because they have no knowledge
of right and wrong. They may tell falsehoods before
they have strength of intellect to comprehend wrong,
and it is no sin to them; but when the child reaches
such maturity of mind as to know right and wrong,
a falsehood then told makes him a transgressor and
he feels the guilt of sin upon his soul, which he never
felt unto that hour. The evil nature that influenced
him to speak falsely did not condemn him, it is the
yielding to such a nature that brought the condemnation.
God commands him to repent. Of what?
Not of the evil inclined disposition, but of the sin
of lying. Suppose the child after a year, or a few
years does repent of his sins; he repents of all, even
to his first, but his repentance goes no farther; he
is no farther responsible, and it is impossible for man
to repent of that for which he is not responsible. God
forgives him, and the forgiveness extends just as far
as the repentance.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Man is not pardoned or forgiven of that for which
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page115">[pg 115]</span><a name="Pg115" id="Pg115" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
he is wholly irresponsible. Every committed sin is
forgiven, even to the first, and he is as innocent and
free from sin and guilt as when a babe in his mother's
arms. This is the first work of grace. He is justified, he
is born again, or reborn—brought back to the state of
his babyhood. <span class="tei tei-q">“Except ye be converted, and become
as little children, ye shall not enter into the kingdom
of heaven.”</span> Mat. 18:3. Conversion or the first work
of grace restores us to the happy innocency of childhood.
The evil nature still remains to be removed in
sanctification, the second work of grace. This is not
an act of forgiveness or pardon, but a cleansing. It
is not through repentance, but consecration.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The Jewish economy contains types and shadows
of this twofold salvation. Egyptian bondage is typical
of sin. Crossing the Red Sea is typical of justification.
Crossing the Jordan, that of sanctification.
The Jewish tabernacle consisting of the holy and most
holy place is a shadow of the spiritual tabernacle of
God—the church. The disciples were saved men
before Pentecost. That was the date of their sanctification.
In reading the eighth chapter of Acts we
learn at the fifth verse that Philip went down to
Samaria and preached Christ, and many believed.
Evil spirits were cast out and the palsied and lame
were healed. They certainly were Christians. Reading
on to the fourteenth verse we learn that Peter and
John went down and prayed for them and they received
the Holy Ghost. The Holy Ghost is the sanctifier.
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page116">[pg 116]</span><a name="Pg116" id="Pg116" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Rom. 15:16. Cornelius was a devout Christian
man, fearing God, giving much alms to the people,
and praying to God always. He was directed in
a vision by an angel of God to send to Joppa for
Peter. When Peter was come he preached unto them,
and as he spoke the Holy Ghost fell on all them which
heard the word. Acts 10th chapter. He with his
household were devout Christians before they received
the Holy Spirit—the sanctifier.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
We will now quote a few texts of Scripture teaching
two works of grace. <span class="tei tei-q">“Therefore being justified by
faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus
Christ: by whom also we have access by faith into this
grace [sanctification] wherein we stand, and rejoice
in hope of the glory of God.”</span> Rom. 5:1, 2. Paul
says to the Gentiles that he was sent unto them <span class="tei tei-q">“to
open their eyes, and to turn them from darkness to
light, and from the power of Satan unto God, that
they may receive forgiveness of sins, and inheritance
among them which are sanctified by faith that is
in me.”</span> Acts 26:18. <span class="tei tei-q">“Not by works of righteousness
which we have done, but according to his mercy he
saved us, by the washing of regeneration, and renewing
of the Holy Ghost.”</span> Titus 3:5.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The Thessalonian brethren were abounding in faith
and love and patience of hope in Jesus; however Paul
tells them that God wills their sanctification. 1 Thes.
4:3. The apostle exhorts the Roman church to a perfect
consecration of life and all to God that they might
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page117">[pg 117]</span><a name="Pg117" id="Pg117" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
<span class="tei tei-q">“prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect
will of God.”</span> Rom. 12:1, 2. This <span class="tei tei-q">“perfect will”</span> is
sanctification. These texts we consider sufficient to give
light unto the teachable, and any number perhaps
would be without force or effect unto the unteachable.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The two works of grace are very generally misunderstood,
especially the grace of sanctification. We believe
God will help us here to make it clear to many a
reader. Justification, the first work of grace, is a full
pardon of every transgression, a removal of guilt. A
justified life is one wholly free from transgression.
The justified do not commit sin. Sanctification is a
destruction of the depraved nature, or a cleansing of
inherited sin from the soul. This grace fully prepares
the soul for heaven. The soul is as pure in this grace
as it will be in heaven. All elements and dispositions
contrary to the nature of heaven are dethroned. All
pride, levity, lust, and impatience proceeding from an
evil nature are perfectly cleansed away. To have
pride in a pure heart is impossible. To have lust or
lightness or impatience in a pure heart is equally impossible.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
We might ask the question, Will not the sanctified
under any circumstance have the slightest yieldings
to exaltation, levity and impatience? and, if the sanctified
speak a word in lightness or impatience does he
forfeit the experience? We will answer these questions
in the fear of God. Many who have claimed the
experience of sanctification have found discouraging
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page118">[pg 118]</span><a name="Pg118" id="Pg118" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
trouble at this point. In the company of flatterers
they yielded to the spirit of exaltation. In the company
of the frivolous they have yielded to the spirit
of levity. Under a severe trial they have spoken
words of impatience, and are then almost in despair.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Man is a twofold being, an inward spiritual man,
and an outward physical man. In sanctification the inward
man is possessed only by God. The physical
members are to be used by the soul to the praise of
God. Satan will bring his force to bear against the
outward man to influence to evil and thus destroy the
life of the soul. Thus the physical being becomes the
battle ground between God in the soul and Satan.
Early in the experience of sanctification when there
has been but little time for development there may be
slight triumphs of Satan without forfeiting the experience
of sanctification, but the soul is awakened to
greater activity and earnestness to control every action
and word to the praise of God. The Lord is sought
in earnest prayer for more of his power, for more of
his grace, that they may be more deeply fortified in
the life divine. The slight victories of the evil one
become slighter and less frequent. The individual
thus increases in faith, in humility, in gentleness, in
kindness, in love according to the additions required
to make our calling and election sure. 2 Pet. 1. By
giving diligence the soul ere long will gain such power
in God as to authoritatively command the perfect obedience
of every member of the physical being. The
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page119">[pg 119]</span><a name="Pg119" id="Pg119" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
body will be kept under subjection and every member
used as an instrument of righteousness unto God.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Any diseased condition of the outward man is an
advantage to Satan. Shattered nerves strengthen
his temptations to impatience and discouragements.
That Satan may have no advantage over us, God in his
plan of redemption made provision for the healing of
the body. If the soul through prosperity or otherwise
becomes slothful, disease may be permitted to attack
the body, or other afflictions may come to awaken to
greater watchfulness. To become more hasty of
speech, to become less grave, to become less humble
and meek, less patient, is to be correspondingly losing
the power of God, and is called backsliding. There
are those to-day who have been claiming to be sanctified
for some years, and they are no more patient nor
sober-minded nor sound in speech, no more humble,
nor have more faith than they had the first year of
their experience. In all probability they are backslidden
and have naught but an empty form. By diligence,
careful watching and incessant prayer, the
soul can reign triumphant. Every look, every action,
every word, and thought will be under the direct influence
of the divine life, and soul, body, and spirit be
preserved blameless until the coming of the Lord.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Holiness is the image of God. A holy seer, in a vision,
saw the Lord and his high throne. He saw the
angels hovering over and heard one shouting, <span class="tei tei-q">“Holy,
holy, holy, is the Lord of hosts: the whole earth is full
of his glory.”</span> Isa. 6:1-3. Nothing in earth or in
heaven is so beautiful as holiness. The Scriptures are
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page125">[pg 125]</span><a name="Pg125" id="Pg125" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
sublime in their description of the loveliness of the
celestial world. Poets have sung of the exquisite delights
of that better land. The crowning feature of
attractiveness is holiness. Should the despiser of holiness
be permitted to stroll through the fields of heaven
he would find no object of beauty there. The rose of
Sharon would be but a faded flower, <span class="tei tei-q">“no beauty that
we should desire him.”</span> Isa. 53:2.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The one object and desire in the life of the sweet
singer David, a holiness admirer, was to dwell in the
house of the Lord all his days to <span class="tei tei-q">“behold the beauty
of the Lord.”</span> Psa. 27:4. The beautiful holy image
of God was seen upon man in his creation. He manifested
the holy character of his Creator. He was in
nature like God. The Almighty in looking over the
works of creation saw that everything he had made,
man included, was very good (Gen. 1:31); therefore
we can rightly conclude that as he looked upon man he
looked upon a creature as pure and holy and faultless
as an angel in heaven, else he would not have
pronounced him very good. Such without controversy
was the state of man by creation: as holy and as pure
in his nature as his Maker. But a sorrowful change
came to man. He transgressed the law of his God,
and as a result the holy image of the Creator was
supplanted by the hideous deformity of sin.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
After the transgression, God again looked upon man
and <span class="tei tei-q">“saw that his wickedness was very great in the
earth, and that every imagination of the thoughts of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page126">[pg 126]</span><a name="Pg126" id="Pg126" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
his heart was only evil continually.”</span> Gen. 6:5. This
grieved him at his heart, and he repented of having
made man. However he purposes that man shall yet
enjoy the blessing of a holy state. Accordingly he
sent his Son to this world to redeem him. This Son
was in the image of the Father <span class="tei tei-q">“in whom the god of
this world hath blinded the minds of them which believe
not, lest the light of the glorious gospel of Christ,
who is the image of God, should shine unto them.”</span> 2
Cor. 4:4. <span class="tei tei-q">“Who is the image of the invisible God,
the first-born of every creature.”</span> Col. 1:15.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The Father has ordained that man in the Son should
be made holy or in his original purity. <span class="tei tei-q">“According
as he hath chosen us in him before the foundation of
the world, that we should be holy and without blame
before him in love.”</span> Eph. 1:4. <span class="tei tei-q">“In holiness and
righteousness before him, all the days of our life.”</span>
Luke 1:75.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In being restored to holiness man is conformed to
the image of the Son. <span class="tei tei-q">“For whom he did foreknow, he
also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of
his Son, that he might be the first-born among many
brethren.”</span> Rom. 8:29. It is true God foreknew that
some would not believe on his Son and be redeemed,
and he foreknew that others would. Here we behold
the wonderful mercy of God. He strives with the
heart of the sinner and brings all influences possible
to bear upon him to turn him from his sin, and all
the time knowing he would never be saved; however
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page127">[pg 127]</span><a name="Pg127" id="Pg127" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
he thus leaves him without excuse and makes him
wholly responsible for his loss.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
What is the image of the Son? He was holy, harmless,
and undefiled. Heb. 7:26. He was equal with
God. Phil. 2:6. He was in the glory and holiness of
the Father. God after creation looked over the work
of his hands and pronounced all very good. After the
<span class="tei tei-q">“transgression”</span> he saw that all was very wicked. Now
Jesus comes and presents to the Father one who has
been redeemed by the all-atoning blood, and as God
views him over he stands <span class="tei tei-q">“holy and unblamable and
unreprovable in his sight.”</span> Halleluiah! Read Col.
1:21, 22. The redemption obtained through the blood
of Jesus is perfect and complete. It makes us <span class="tei tei-q">“complete
in him.”</span> Col. 2:10. Dear reader, this moment,
with open heart before the all-seeing eye of God, does
the Spirit witness clearly to your soul that you are
<span class="tei tei-q">“holy and without blame before him in love?”</span> To
be like Jesus includes only his holy nature. We are
not to be like him in power to forgive sins, but in a
holy life. We are to be thus like him in this present
life; <span class="tei tei-q">“because as he is, so are we in this world.”</span> 1
John 4:17. In this world, we are to be like him in
holiness. <span class="tei tei-q">“But as he which hath called you is holy,
so be ye holy in all manner of conversation; because
it is written, <span class="tei tei-q">‘Be ye holy; for I am holy.’</span> ”</span> 1 Pet. 1:15,
16. God predestinated that we should be like him.
He is holy, therefore he calls the believer unto holiness.
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page128">[pg 128]</span><a name="Pg128" id="Pg128" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
When we are restored to the holy nature of God
it will be our nature to be as merciful as he is merciful.
<span class="tei tei-q">“Be ye therefore merciful, as your Father also
is merciful.”</span> Luke 6:36. The mercy of God consists
in showing favor unsolicited; in bestowing blessings
upon the ungrateful. God in his mercy gave his Son
to die for a wicked world. When we are made partakers
of the divine nature, we go about showing favor
and kindness to all; though men scorn us, revile us,
and trample us down without mercy, we eagerly seize
every opportunity to do them good.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
With respect to the principles of Christianity we
are, when fully redeemed, perfect as our Father in
heaven. <span class="tei tei-q">“Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father
which is in heaven is perfect.”</span> Mat. 5:48. By reading
the contexts we find he is speaking of love. When
fully saved there is naught in our heart but love,
loving just as God loves. Such love enables us with
joy to show kindness to our enemies, to feed them
when they are hungry, and give them drink when they
thirst. Rom. 12:20.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
When we are fully saved we are like the Lord in
purity: <span class="tei tei-q">“And every man that hath this hope in him
purifieth himself, even as he is pure.”</span> 1 John 3:3.
Every crimson stain of sin is cleansed away and we
are whiter than the snow. The evil nature incurred
by Adam's sin is perfectly destroyed and we are made
as pure as though there had never been a sin in this
world.
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page129">[pg 129]</span><a name="Pg129" id="Pg129" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
We will be like our Creator and Redeemer in righteousness:
<span class="tei tei-q">“Little children, let no man deceive you: he
that doeth righteousness is righteous, even as he is
righteous.”</span> 1 John 3:7. Some do teach that we can
not be righteous. The Word of God declares they
are deceivers.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
When we thus become of the pure, holy, righteous
and merciful nature of Jesus it will of necessity separate
us as far from this world and worldliness as he
was separated. <span class="tei tei-q">“I have given them thy word; and
the world hath hated them, because they are not of
the world, even as I am not of the world.”</span> John 17:14.
There lies a great and wide gulf between the
Christian and the world. Jesus is the bridge for the
sinner to cross to the Christian's land. Sin and Satan
is the bridge for the return of the Christian to the
world.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
When the children of God are fully redeemed they
are one even as the Father and the Son are one.
<span class="tei tei-q">“And the glory which thou gavest me I have given
them; that they may be one, even as we are one.”</span>
John 17:22. This means a complete annihilation of
every partisan spirit, a destruction of all strife and
division. Should every professed Christian get salvation
to the full Bible standard there would not be a
sect left upon earth.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
God predestinated you to be conformed to the image
of his Son; holy as he is holy; merciful as he is merciful;
perfect as he is perfect; pure as he is pure;
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page130">[pg 130]</span><a name="Pg130" id="Pg130" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
righteous as he is righteous; as far separated from the
world as he is from the world, and one even as God
and his Son are one. Such is the perfect redemption
offered to man in this life through God's beloved Son.
What can be more beautiful upon this earth than a
soul redeemed from sin and a life reflecting the holy
life of the Savior. <span class="tei tei-q">“Christ before Pilate”</span> is a rare
and much admired work of art, but Christ in the soul
and life is a work more grand and beautiful. For
man to properly reflect the divine character necessitates
a very close walk and deep communion with the
Deity. There must be a constant feeding upon the divine
life. There must be a careful watching and an
effort to cultivate a deeper sense of the presence of
God. Happy and blessed is the man whose heart is so
filled with heavenly love and reverence to God as to
cause him to give <span class="tei tei-q">“all diligence”</span> to develop into his
own glorious image.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The word church is a much misused word. It is
commonly used at the present day when speaking of
the edifices erected for the purpose of the assembling
of the church to worship God. The quoting of a few
texts will give us the Bible definition of this word.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Likewise greet the church that is in their house.”</span>
Rom. 16:5. This was the home of Priscilla and
Aquila. This church was in their house. This
house was not the church. The church was in their
house. The command was to greet the church. This
certainly begins to throw some light upon this subject.
See 1 Cor. 16:19; Col. 4:15; Phile. 2. <span class="tei tei-q">“And he
hath put all things under his feet, and gave him to be
head over all things to the church, which is his body,
the fulness of him that filleth all in all.”</span> Eph. 1:22, 23.
<span class="tei tei-q">“And he is the head of the body, the church.”</span>
Col. 1:18. See also 24th verse.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
These texts plainly teach the church to be the body
of Christ. What is the body of Christ? Ans.—<span class="tei tei-q">“Now
ye [Christians] are the body of Christ, and members in
particular.”</span> 1 Cor. 12:27. The body of Christ is the
church. The church is Christians. This enables us
to understand how the church could be in Priscilla
and Aquila's house, and how we can greet the church.
This is the Bible definition of church.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In the writings of the apostles the plural form of
the word church is frequently used, but this argues
nothing against the unity of God's church, nor in
favor of the multiplicity of sects. If all the saved
people in the world could be congregated in one place
there would be no occasion for using the plural form
of this word. Had it been so in the days of the writers
of the epistles, the word would have been used only
in the singular. But since there was a church or congregation
of Christians at Antioch, also a church at
Corinth, at Thessalonica, Ephesus, Smyrna, Pergamos,
Thyatira, Sardis, Philadelphia, Laodicea, etc., to
speak of the whole it would be proper to use the plural
of church. <span class="tei tei-q">“The churches of Asia.”</span> Please notice
there is only one in each city, and the same writer addresses
them all.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It does not take a town of so great a size to-day to
find seven towering meeting-house steeples, where assemble
as many different bodies of believers, termed
sects. No one minister addresses them all. No one
elder gives orders to all these different sects. 1 Cor. 16:1.
No one minister ordains elders in all the separate
bodies. 1 Cor. 7:17. The word churches was
used to denote the different geographical location of
the congregations of the Lord. The minister arguing
in favor of the plurality of denominations from the
plural term churches as found in the Bible is either
ignorant or unfair. A plurality of sects is Babylon
confusion.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The plural form is used in the Bible with reference
to location and not to bodies having a different faith
or belief. The church at Antioch had no contrary
faith with the church at Corinth as we find existing
between the denominations of to-day. They were
separated by geographical distance, and not by difference
of belief. Had these different churches come
together in one place they could all have listened
to Paul preach and said, Amen.

<span class="tei tei-q">“The multitude of them that believed were of one
heart and of one soul.”</span> Acts 4:32. Can these same
words be correctly used when speaking of the believers
throughout the various denominations of to-day?
<span class="tei tei-q">“Now the God of patience and consolation grant you
to be likeminded one toward another according to
Christ Jesus: that ye may with one mind and one
mouth glorify God, even the Father of our Lord Jesus
Christ.”</span> Rom. 15:5, 6. <span class="tei tei-q">“Now I beseech you, brethren,
by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that ye all
speak the same thing, and that there be no divisions
among you; but that ye be perfectly joined together
in the same mind and in the same judgment.”</span> 1 Cor. 1:10.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
By these two texts we learn that the church of God
has but one mind; it has but one mouth, and all speak
the same thing. This is beautiful, this is heavenly.
<span class="tei tei-q">“Behold, how good and how pleasant it is for brethren
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page134">[pg 134]</span><a name="Pg134" id="Pg134" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
to dwell together in unity.”</span> Psa. 133:1. It is
only the church of the Bible that enjoys this pleasant
unity, and we must never confound this church with
the confusive sects. Babylon has as many mouths as
there are sects, and they speak contrary things.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“For ye are all one in Christ Jesus.”</span> Gal. 3:28.
<span class="tei tei-q">“Only let your conversation be as it becometh the
gospel of Christ: that whether I come and see you, or
else be absent, I may hear of your affairs, that ye
stand fast in one spirit, with one mind striving together
for the faith of the gospel.”</span> Phil. 1:27. <span class="tei tei-q">“Fulfil
ye my joy, that ye be likeminded, having the same
love, being of one accord, of one mind.”</span> Phil. 2:2.
<span class="tei tei-q">“For as we have many members in one body, and all
the members have not the same office: so we, being
many, are one body in Christ, and every one members
one of another.”</span> Rom. 12:4, 5.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Other sheep I have, which are not of this fold:
them also I must bring, ... and there shall be one
fold and one shepherd.”</span> John 10:16. The Savior was
here speaking of the Gentiles and the Jews. Before the
coming of Christ there was a partition wall between
these two nations, but Jesus came to break down the
middle wall of partition, so there should be neither
Jew nor Greek, bond nor free, male nor female: but
all one in Christ Jesus. Gal. 3:28. <span class="tei tei-q">“For as the body
is one, and hath many members, and all the members
of that one body, being many, are one body: so also
is Christ. For by one Spirit are we all baptized into
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page135">[pg 135]</span><a name="Pg135" id="Pg135" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
one body, whether we be Jews or Gentiles, whether
we be bond or free; and have been all made to drink
into one Spirit.”</span> 1 Cor. 12:12, 13.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The <span class="tei tei-q">“many members”</span> here referred to are individual
Christians, and not the ecclesiastical bodies now
extant, as some do ignorantly teach. <span class="tei tei-q">“But now are
they many members, yet but one body.”</span> 1 Cor. 12:20.
In the fifteenth and sixteenth verses the apostle uses
the physical body of man with its dependent members
to illustrate the one body of Christ. These members
work in blissful harmony and are dependent upon
each other. A destruction of one member impairs the
whole body. This is not illustrative of the different
denominations; they are not dependent upon each
other. Oftentimes they are opposed to each other, and
thrive better when others are destroyed.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“And let the peace of God rule in your hearts, to
the which also ye are called in one body, and be ye
thankful.”</span> Col. 3:15.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I am thankful that we are called as humble followers
of the Lamb, into one body only, where the peace
of God rules in every heart. <span class="tei tei-q">“Now therefore ye are no
more strangers and foreigners, but fellow citizens
with the saints, and of the household of God.”</span> Eph.
2:19. God has a household of saints here upon the
earth where peace rules. A contentious, quarrelsome,
divided family is no part of God's united household.
One family in heaven and earth. Eph. 3:15. It is
with great reluctancy that we pass by so many beautiful
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page136">[pg 136]</span><a name="Pg136" id="Pg136" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
texts upon this subject, but we will only quote
a few more lest this volume swell to too great proportions.
<span class="tei tei-q">“Holy Father, keep through thine own
name those whom thou hast given me, that they may
be one, as we are. While I was with them in the world,
I kept them in thy name: ... neither pray I for these
alone, but for them also which shall believe on me
through their word; that they all may be one; as thou,
Father, art in me, and I in thee, that they also may
be one in us: that the world may believe that thou
hast sent me. And the glory which thou gavest me
I have given them; that they may be one, even as we
are one: I in them and thou in me, that they may be
made perfect in one; and that the world may know
that thou hast sent me, and hast loved them as thou
hast loved me.”</span> John 17:11, 12, 20-23.

From the apostle they had learned the doctrine of

your dictionary you will find the word <span class="tei tei-q">“schism”</span> to
be synonymous with the word <span class="tei tei-q">“sect.”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“A man that
is a heretic after the first and second admonition reject.”</span>
Titus 3:10. Many translators have rendered
heretic, sectarian.

Heresies and divisions are here spoken of as meaning
about the same thing; or rather divisions are occasioned
by heresies. If you will look in the margin

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
We will have to go to the dictionary to find a definition
of the word <span class="tei tei-q">“organize,”</span> since the word is not
found in the Bible. <span class="tei tei-q">“To arrange in parts; to form
in due order; to furnish with organs,”</span> is the common
definition. While the term <span class="tei tei-q">“organize”</span> is not contained
in the Scriptures, yet the work of organizing
God's church was performed, and his precious
truth tells us how, and by whom it was done. <span class="tei tei-q">“For
to one [individual] is given by the Spirit the word of
wisdom; to another the word of knowledge by the
same Spirit; to another faith by the same Spirit; to
another the gifts of healing by the same Spirit; to another
the working of miracles; to another prophecy; to
another discerning of spirits, to another divers kinds
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page139">[pg 139]</span><a name="Pg139" id="Pg139" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of tongues; to another the interpretation of tongues:
but all these worketh that one and the selfsame Spirit,
dividing to every man severally as he will.”</span> 1 Cor. 12:8-11.
Nothing need be plainer. It is the mission of
the Holy Spirit to impart unto or bestow upon each
member of God's church such qualifications as will
make him a useful and effectual organ in this holy
structure.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
What is necessary for the building and furnishing
of the church of God is not necessary in the formation
and organization of a man-made ecclesiasticism. For
man to build what he is pleased to call a church he
does not have to furnish it with <span class="tei tei-q">“a gift of faith,”</span>
nor <span class="tei tei-q">“a gift of healing,”</span> nor of <span class="tei tei-q">“working of miracles,”</span>
nor of <span class="tei tei-q">“prophecy,”</span> nor of <span class="tei tei-q">“discerning of
spirits,”</span> nor of <span class="tei tei-q">“diversities of tongues,”</span> nor of
<span class="tei tei-q">“interpretation of tongues.”</span> Neither does he require
the <span class="tei tei-q">“wisdom of God,”</span> nor the <span class="tei tei-q">“knowledge of God.”</span>
It is true he will require much knowledge and wisdom
of the world, but of all the things necessary in furnishing
the church of God, not one of them is necessary
in the building of a sect.

and some, evangelists; and some, pastors and teachers;

Eph. 4:10-12. <span class="tei tei-q">“Take heed therefore unto yourselves,

Ghost hath made you overseers, to feed the church of

up. Great was the speculation throughout Jewry

<span class="tei tei-q">“Verily I say unto you, Except ye be converted,

apostle in Rom. 14:17 explains the nature of this kingdom:

ere this that the church of God and the
kingdom of heaven are the same spiritual structure.
In the twelfth chapter of Hebrews several terms are
used to denote the church of God. In the twenty-second
verse it is designated by <span class="tei tei-q">“mount Zion,”</span> the
<span class="tei tei-q">“city of the living God,”</span> the <span class="tei tei-q">“heavenly Jerusalem,”</span>
and an <span class="tei tei-q">“innumerable company of angels.”</span> In verse
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page145">[pg 145]</span><a name="Pg145" id="Pg145" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
twenty-three it is denominated <span class="tei tei-q">“general assembly,”</span>
<span class="tei tei-q">“the church of the first-born,”</span> etc. In the twenty-eighth
verse it is called the <span class="tei tei-q">“kingdom.”</span> By this we
are made to understand that the church built by
the Lord is identical with the <span class="tei tei-q">“city of God,”</span> the
<span class="tei tei-q">“kingdom of God,”</span> the <span class="tei tei-q">“heavenly Jerusalem,”</span> etc.
With this understanding we will better comprehend
the meaning of many other texts.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
God sets the members in the body of Christ, which
is the church, as seemeth best according to his unbounded
wisdom. All are not an eye or ear or hand
or foot. That the church of God may be complete as
a body it has all the different members. Christ is
the head, and the saved men and women are the other
members of the body according to their calling, all
governed by the head and consecrated to do his will.
The ministry are the feet, the burden-bearers, the
servants of all. They have the care or burden of the
church. They carry the glad tidings of salvation.
They are not to be carried about and served, but they
are the servants. <span class="tei tei-q">“How beautiful are the feet of
them that preach the gospel of peace, and bring glad
tidings of good things.”</span> Rom. 10:15.

The following officers are mentioned in the New
Testament: apostles, prophets, evangelists, bishops,
pastors, teachers, deacons, elders, and presbyters.
Apostle is from the Greek <span class="tei tei-q">“<span lang="el" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="el"><span style="font-style: italic">apostolos</span></span>,”</span>
which is one sent forth to plant. Paul was an apostle. He was sent
forth by the Holy Spirit. Acts 13:4. He was sent
forth to plant. 1 Cor. 3:6. Prophet is from the
Greek <span class="tei tei-q">“<span lang="el" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="el"><span style="font-style: italic">prophetes</span></span>,”</span>
which is one who is an expounder
of prophecies and revelations and of future events.
Agabus was a prophet, a teller of future events.
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page147">[pg 147]</span><a name="Pg147" id="Pg147" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
See Acts 21:10, 11 and Acts 11: 28. Philip the evangelist
had four daughters who did prophesy, or expound
or explain the Scriptures. An evangelist is
one who announces good tidings, while an apostle is
one who plants churches or goes into new localities,
and through whose preaching people are saved and a
church thus planted. The mission of an evangelist
is to visit those planted churches and water them.
<span class="tei tei-q">“I have planted, Apollos watered; but God gave the
increase.”</span> 1 Cor. 3:6.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Bishop is from the Greek <span class="tei tei-q">“<span lang="el" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="el"><span style="font-style: italic">episkopos</span></span>,”</span>
and means a superintendent or overseer. Pastor is from the
Greek <span class="tei tei-q">“<span lang="el" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="el"><span style="font-style: italic">poimen</span></span>,”</span>
and means shepherd or feeder or overseer, the same as bishop; consequently bishop
and pastor are the same, an overseer or shepherd.
The word <span class="tei tei-q">“overseer”</span> occurs but once in the New
Testament: <span class="tei tei-q">“Take heed therefore unto yourselves,
and to all the flock, over the which the Holy Ghost
hath made you overseers, to feed the church of God.”</span>
Acts 20:28. Overseer in this text is translated from
the Greek <span class="tei tei-q">“<span lang="el" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="el"><span style="font-style: italic">episkopos</span></span>,”</span>
from which same Greek word
we have the word bishop. Paul was then addressing
bishops, and tells them to feed the church of God.
Now a pastor is a feeder; therefore bishop and pastor
are two words used to denote the same office. To note
the qualifications of a bishop or pastor as set forth in
the New Testament will doubtless be edifying to the
reader.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
A bishop must be blameless, the husband of one
wife, vigilant, sober, of good behavior, given to hospitality,
apt to teach; patient, ruling well his own house,
a lover of good men, just, holy, temperate, etc. See
1 Tim. 3:2-4: Titus 1:7, 8.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Blameless. This word is synonymous with spotless,
faultless, irreproachable. A person or thing is blameless
when it is free from fault.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The husband of one wife. No one can meet the
New Testament requirements for bishop or pastor
who has two wives, though one be divorced.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Vigilant. He must be so watchful as to early
discover danger of any kind and use the utmost
precaution to avoid it.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Sober. This word is not applied only to freedom
from intoxication by spirituous liquors, but is synonymous
with calmness, quietness, grave, sedate, steady,
serious, solemn, etc. The Greek
<span class="tei tei-q">“<span lang="el" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="el"><span style="font-style: italic">sophron</span></span>”</span> for sober
in these texts means sound mindedness.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Of good behavior. Their conduct must be free
from levity, folly, or anything that tends to degrade
morals.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Given to hospitality. (Lover of hospitality. Titus
1:8.) He must love in his heart to receive and entertain
strangers without remuneration, to be kind and
pleasing in his manners.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Apt to teach. He must possess a talent or God-given
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page149">[pg 149]</span><a name="Pg149" id="Pg149" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
ability to teach the Word to others in a simple
manner.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Patient. He must be free from ill passion and
irritableness. He must be calm, and possess a tranquility
and evenness of life. His composure and holy
tranquilness is such that commands and quiets all
strife, contentions and heated discussions.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Ruling well his own house. Unless a man has sufficient
wisdom, authority, love and firmness, to govern
and control his own children he certainly can not be
used of God to oversee the church of God.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Lover of good men. His very heart and soul must
admire and appreciate and love the good he sees in
men.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Just. In his admonitions, corrections and reprovings,
he is always just and impartial.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Holy. His heart and life and affections must be
pure and holy, free from sin.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Temperate. There are many things from which
we are commanded by the Scriptures to abstain.
In the use of all things God has given for use he
must not be excessive. He must not be excessive in
eating, drinking, sleeping, working, talking, sexual
relation, etc.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
A bishop must not be given to wine, no striker,
not greedy of filthy lucre, not a brawler, not covetous,

Must not be given to wine. Not a wine drinker.
He is to be an example and abstain from all appearance
of evil.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
No striker. A good translation from the Greek
would render this <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">reviler</span></em>. He must not strike back
with the tongue; in other words, not contentious.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Not greedy of filthy lucre. When man becomes
greedy of filthy lucre—loves money—he can be influenced
by it and thus be led to favor the rich.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Not a brawler. This is synonymous with wrangler
or contender.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Not Covetous. Covetousness includes more than
the love of money. Fame, honor, worldly pleasures,
gratification of unholy appetites and passions, may be
properly termed covetousness. To entertain for anything
an affection that is not a pure and godly
affection is idolatry, and idolatry is covetousness.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Not a novice. One newly converted.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Not self-willed. Not obstinate in contending for
his views or desires in opposition to others.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Not soon angry. Soon is not found in the original.
A more proper rendering would be, Not passionate.

Deacon is translated from <span class="tei tei-q">“<span lang="el" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="el"><span style="font-style: italic">diakonos</span></span>,”</span>
meaning minister. By reading the writings of those contemporary

This doubtless is what is meant by <span class="tei tei-q">“helps”</span> in 1 Cor.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Webster in defining presbyter, says, <span class="tei tei-q">“An elder in
the early Christian church.”</span> Young in his analytical

These two terms have the same Greek origin,
<span class="tei tei-q">“<span lang="el" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="el"><span style="font-style: italic">presbuteros</span></span>.”</span>
An elder is one grounded in the faith
with a sound matured judgment; one capable of giving
good advice or counsel. An elder is not necessarily
a preacher, but one calculated to advise and give
counsel in his pastoral duties. They also are especially
called of God to anoint and pray for the sick.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
These church officers are all called of God. See Gal.

Sent by the Holy Spirit. Acts 13: 3, 4. They are
qualified by God. 2 Cor. 3:5, 6. They are ambassadors
from the kingdom of heaven with a heavenly

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In the preceding chapter we considered the church
of the New Testament. The Lord Jesus built his
church and instituted some ordinances, which he commands
the church to faithfully keep. The keeping of
the commandments of God is proof that we love him:
<span class="tei tei-q">“For this is the love of God that we keep his commandments:
and his commandments are not grievous.”</span>
1 John 5:3. <span class="tei tei-q">“He that hath my commandments,
and keepeth them, he it is that loveth me.”</span>
John 14:21. <span class="tei tei-q">“If a man love me he will keep my
words.”</span> Ver. 23. <span class="tei tei-q">“He that loveth me not keepeth
not my sayings.”</span> Ver. 24.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
We may profess great attainments in the divine life
and wonderful devotion to God, but the proof is
obedience to his commands. We have learned of people
who have become so holy that they were raised above
or passed beyond a great portion of the Bible
and are not required to keep it. We have heard of
but few things so ridiculously foolish. The better
and more holy we become, certainly the more of the
Word of God we will practise in our life; and who
on earth can live a more perfect Christian life than
he who lives in obedience to every word of the Bible?
When one gets in possession of something that exempts
him from obedience to the Scriptures he gets
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page153">[pg 153]</span><a name="Pg153" id="Pg153" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
in possession of some very mysterious thing. The only
way to heaven is by the commandments of the Bible.
<span class="tei tei-q">“Blessed are they that do his commandments, that
they may have a right to the tree of life and enter in
through the gates into the city.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">

which belong to the church of God as recorded in the

though a fool need not err therein.

<span class="tei tei-q">“There was a man sent from God, whose name was
John.”</span> John 1:6. In the thirty-third verse this
same John declares that God sent him to baptize with
water. Of the books written on this subject there is
scarcely an end. The controversy is very great, and
so often very ridiculous. Lexicographers have defined
and analyzed the word baptize in its different
forms. Liddell and Scott, Robertson, Parkhurst,
Scapula, Stokins, Calvin, Luther, Campbell, Gill,
Stuart, Vitringa, Brenner, Paulus, and many others
of great erudition have defined the word, and to sum
them all up we find the primary meaning is <span class="tei tei-q">“to dip,
to immerse, to plunge in water.”</span> Many of the English
translators of the New Testament always render
<span lang="el" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="el"><span style="font-style: italic">baptizo</span></span>,
immerse or dip, as <span class="tei tei-q">“John the immerser,”</span>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
All Jerusalem, and Judea, and the region about
Jordan, were baptized of John in Jordan. Mat. 3:5, 6.
Jesus baptized by proxy. John 4:1, 2. He commissioned
his ministry to preach baptism unto all the
world. <span class="tei tei-q">“Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing
them in the name of the Father, and of the
Son, and of the Holy Ghost.”</span> Mat. 28:19. <span class="tei tei-q">“Go ye
into all the world, and preach the gospel to every
creature. He that believeth and is baptized shall be
saved.”</span> Mark 16:15, 16. Those who have undertaken
the dangerous and Christ uncommissioned task of
freeing Christians from the obligations of this ordinance,
hold high aloft the following texts: Eph. 2:15;
Col. 2:14, 15; Col. 2:20. Since the Savior's commission
to his disciples was forty days after his resurrection,
such teachers are driven from this position, and to
substantiate their doctrine they flee to a more fatally
exposed one when saying that the baptism of this commission
was the baptism of the Spirit. It is a pity
that precious time must be taken for the correction of
such erroneous teaching. How can men baptize with
the Holy Spirit? God alone can do that.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It is evident that the apostles understood this baptism
to be with water, since they taught it and practised
it throughout their ministry. We shall take
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page155">[pg 155]</span><a name="Pg155" id="Pg155" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
time and space to refer to but two or three instances
of the administration of this ordinance recorded in the
Acts of the Apostles. The first is that of a Christ commissioned
preacher by the name of Philip, who was
sent by an angel to preach the gospel to a Scripturally
ignorant man of Ethiopia. Unlearned as he
was, he readily understood from the preaching of
Philip the importance of water baptism; therefore
when they came to a certain water he said, <span class="tei tei-q">“See here
is water; what doth hinder me to be baptized?”</span> Acts
8:36. By reading the following verses you will learn
that this man was baptized in water and God witnessed
to his approval by sending him rejoicing on his
way. Obedience to the commands of God brings a
joy to the Christian heart.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The second instance of baptism to which we wish
to invite your attention is that of the devout Cornelius.
He sent for Peter to learn more concerning the ways
of the Lord. Peter came and told them of Jesus, of his
resurrection and his power to save. As he spoke the
Holy Ghost fell upon all them which heard his words.
Then said Peter, Can any man forbid water that these
should not be baptized which have received the Holy
Ghost as well as we? And he commanded them to be
baptized in the name of the Lord. How can an instance
of water baptism be more plainly recorded? This
occurred some eight years after the crucifixion of the
Lord Jesus. To teach the abolition of this ordinance
at the cross, in the face of these plainly stated instances
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page156">[pg 156]</span><a name="Pg156" id="Pg156" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of baptism, only proves to us the blinding
and deceptive power of the spirit of error.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Many of the professed teachers of the gospel have
become very liberal. <span class="tei tei-q">“We all have a right to our
opinion,”</span> so many say; and <span class="tei tei-q">“a thing becomes right
unto us if we believe it to be right.”</span> Because of this
teaching and the varied opinions, there have originated
in the minds of the people several different
modes of baptism. But this great liberality finds no
warrant in the Word of God. The Scriptures teach
that <span class="tei tei-q">“there is one body.”</span> Eph. 4:4. If I should hold
in opinion, as many do hold, that there are many
bodies, would my opinion prove the Word of God to
be in error? Let me say here, with emphasis, that
there can be but one true, rightful body. If the
Catholic body should be the right body, it is the only
body upon the earth that is right. If the Presbyterian
body is the right and true body, it is the only body.
And so with any other denominational body. If we
were a member of the Methodist body we would have
to believe that that was the one true body and that
all the others were wrong. If there be but one body,
how can two bodies be that one body when those two
bodies are different?
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
There is but one Holy Spirit, one true Lord, one
gospel faith, and one true mode of baptism. God has
not left us to follow our own peculiar fancies, but all
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page157">[pg 157]</span><a name="Pg157" id="Pg157" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
must go the same way. Whatever is required of one
individual, that same thing is required of every other
individual. If sprinkling is a right mode of baptism
it is the only right mode, and all others are wrong. If
pouring is right it is the only mode that is right. If
three dips, face forward is right it is the only mode
that is right. If one single immersion is right it is
the only mode that is right. The Lord did not set
the example in all these different ways. He was baptized.
He also baptized by proxy, and we believe that
he thus baptized in the same manner he was baptized.
This one mode was all they understood by baptism.
The apostles perhaps had seen the Lord baptized, they
administered baptism under his direction, and when
he commissioned them with the authority to administer
baptism after he had ascended to the Father, they
did not question him as to which mode. The word
baptism meant but one thing and the same thing unto
them all. In the after years of their ministry they
practised just what they had seen their Lord practise.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Now let us learn from the plain, easy language
of the Scripture the mode as administered by John,
the Lord and the apostles. In the third chapter of
Matthew the inspired writer has given an account of
John's baptism, which we kindly invite you to read.
Now the way to correctly understand the Scripture
is to take it in its easiest, plainest, most sensible way.
Do not attempt to give it some complicated, mysterious
meaning, but receive it as you would any easily
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page158">[pg 158]</span><a name="Pg158" id="Pg158" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
understood historical fact of this present time. If you
should read in your county paper of a man down by
one of the rivers of your adjoining county who was
administering baptism to the people, and the whole
neighborhood round about went out to him and were
baptized of him in the river, and when he had baptized
a certain individual he went up straightway out
of the water, what idea would you form as to the mode
of the baptism? Would you think it was a little water
sprinkled on the head somewhere in a meeting-house?
There is nothing in the account to convey such an
idea. How unreasonable it would be for you to study
to change the meaning of the plain account and mystify
it because it was not congenial to your desires.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Suppose you should read in your paper of two men
traveling along the way. One of them had never
heard of Jesus nor of the ordinance of baptism; the
other talked to him of the Savior, of his death and
his resurrection, and how he had authorized him to go
into all the world and preach this gospel to every
creature, and he that believed and was baptized, the
same should be saved. And as they traveled on their
way they came to a certain water, and the one said to
the other, <span class="tei tei-q">“See here is water, what doth hinder me
to be baptized?”</span> The other replied, <span class="tei tei-q">“If thou believest
with all thine heart thou mayest.”</span> He answered,
<span class="tei tei-q">“I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God.”</span> Then
they stopped their carriage and they went down both
into the water and there the one was baptized of the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page159">[pg 159]</span><a name="Pg159" id="Pg159" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
other, and when they came up out of the water the
one went one way and the other another way, and
they saw each other no more. What idea would you
form as to the mode of baptism? This is all very
plain to the candid heart.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The other instances of baptism recorded in the New
Testament do not express so clearly the mode as the
two we have given, yet they can not with propriety
be made to express anything contrary to immersion.
The apostle Paul in his letter to the Roman brethren
speaks of baptism as a burial. Rom. 6:4. This only
confirms in our mind (concerning the mode) the
ideas suggested by the baptism of the Savior and of
the man of Ethiopia. For yet greater clearness we
will present a few thoughts suggested to us by the recent
writings of a brother, which we consider very
conclusive.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
A word, perfectly synonymous with another word
can be used in its stead with the same correctness of
diction. As, for example, <span class="tei tei-q">“The snow is slowly descending
from the dark cloud.”</span> To use a word synonymous
with <span class="tei tei-q">“descending”</span> in the above sentence
it must express the same thought and present the same
elegance of style. We find such a synonym in the
word <span class="tei tei-q">“falling.”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“The snow is slowly falling from the
dark cloud.”</span> The idea expressed by these two sentences
is precisely the same, and both are good grammar.
Let us now read Rom. 6:4: <span class="tei tei-q">“Therefore we are
buried with him by baptism into death.”</span> To find a word
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page160">[pg 160]</span><a name="Pg160" id="Pg160" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
synonymous with baptism it will not deprive the word
<span class="tei tei-q">“burial”</span> of its proper meaning. Try the word
<span class="tei tei-q">“sprinkle.”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“Therefore we are buried with him by
sprinkling into death.”</span> Please read Mat. 3:5, 6;
Mark 1:9; John 3:2, 3, and use the word sprinkle
or pour where the word baptize is used, and note the
great absurdity. Why is so much time spent in discussion
over declarations so simple, clear and plain?
Because of the perversion of plain language by the
spirit of error to a self-conceited mind.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
There is a religious class of people that teach and
practise three immersions; one in the name of the
Father, one in the name of the Son, and one in the
name of the Holy Ghost. Such teaching is based upon
the construction of Mat. 28:19. Only a little unprejudiced
consideration will enable you to see the
fallacy of such an interpretation. These three are
one. If they were separate and distinct so we could
act in the name of the one to the exclusion of the
others then we could better understand such an interpretation
of the above text. The apostles well
understood that to act in the name of one was to
act in the name of the whole trinity; therefore Peter
says, <span class="tei tei-q">“Repent, and be baptized every one of you in
the name of Jesus Christ.”</span> Acts 2:38. Why did not
Peter use the formula of Mat. 28:19? Because to act
in the name of one is to act in the name of all. <span class="tei tei-q">“And
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page161">[pg 161]</span><a name="Pg161" id="Pg161" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
he commanded them to be baptized in the name of the
Lord.”</span> Acts 10:48. <span class="tei tei-q">“They were baptized in the name
of the Lord Jesus.”</span> Acts 8:16. <span class="tei tei-q">“When they heard
this, they were baptized in the name of the Lord
Jesus.”</span> Acts 19:5.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Nowhere in the Acts of the Apostles is the triune
name used in baptism. Pages could be written showing
the absurdity of the teachings of trine immersionists,
but we consider that what has been written is
clear enough to convince candid, unbiased minds, and
any amount of argument will not convince those who
defiantly set themselves against any reasonings contrary
to their established notions.

<h4 class="tei tei-head" style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 2.00em; margin-top: 2.00em">The Object Of Baptism.</h4>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
There is a baptism taught in the Scriptures that is
not water baptism. There is a baptism of the Spirit.
See 1 Cor. 12:13; Mat. 3:11. Some not being able to
rightly divide the Word of God have taken some texts
that teach the baptism of the Spirit to be the baptism
of water, and thus confused the true object of water
baptism. We will frankly admit that there are some
texts which if taken alone and interpreted literally
do apparently teach that baptism is a saving ordinance.
We will refer the reader to a few of these
texts. Mark 16:16; Acts 2:38; Acts 22:16. These
texts seem to plainly teach that water baptism does
wash away or remit sins. I always prefer to give
each text the simplest, plainest rendering when it
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page162">[pg 162]</span><a name="Pg162" id="Pg162" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
does not conflict with some other text. Now to teach
that baptism by water is a saving ordinance, and so
interpret these texts, we place ourselves in direct
opposition to other plain teaching. Some do teach
that there is none righteous and base such teaching
upon Rom. 3:10. We would ask such teachers to
interpret Titus 2:12; 1 John 3:7, 10; 1 John 2:29;
Luke 1:75. By such texts they are brought to confusion.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Elsewhere in this work we quote the scriptures
teaching salvation from sin to be by the grace of God.
Then to teach that water baptism saves us from sin
makes the Word of God contradict itself. All is beauteous
harmony in the Scriptures when all is correctly
interpreted. Water baptism represents a burial. A
burial must of course be preceded by death. We die
or separate ourselves from a life of sin and accept
Christ; he accepts us. The real death to, and destruction
of sin and resurrection to life is performed by the
power of God's grace, while baptism expresses in a
figure the burial and resurrection to spiritual life.
This is the true object of baptism.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Water baptism is the answer of a good conscience
toward God. 1 Pet. 3:19-21. We must obtain a good
or <span class="tei tei-q">“undefiled conscience”</span> before we are a Scriptural
candidate for baptism. How can defilement be purged
from the conscience? By the blood of Jesus. Heb. 9:14.
We are taught in Mat. 3:8 that we must bear
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page163">[pg 163]</span><a name="Pg163" id="Pg163" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
fruits of repentance to be worthy applicants for baptism.
The man of Ethiopia was asked to profess faith
in Christ before Philip considered him to be a proper
subject for baptism.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Infants can not profess faith in Christ, therefore
their baptism is unscriptural. We are aware that
there are many who teach <span class="tei tei-q">“infant baptism,”</span> and use
a few texts of Scripture and by their misapplication
make it look as plausible as possible. The commission
of the Lord to his ministry is to <span class="tei tei-q">“preach the gospel
to every creature; he that believeth and is baptized
shall be saved.”</span> Faith precedes baptism in the commission.
Infants have not faith. Peter says, <span class="tei tei-q">“Repent
and be baptized.”</span> Acts 2:38. Repentance,
therefore, precedes baptism. John understood it
thus. Mat. 3:8. Infants need no repentance. There
is not a case recorded in the New Testament of infant
baptism. After one has reached the years of accountability
and repents of his sins and is born of the Spirit
he is then, and not until then, a proper candidate
for baptism.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In the teachings of the holy inspired and unblamed
apostle Paul, the expression, <span class="tei tei-q">“The Lord's Supper”</span>
is to be found. In reproving the Corinthians for
corrupting the sacred communion service, he says,
<span class="tei tei-q">“When ye come together therefore into one place,
this is not to eat the Lord's supper,”</span> 1 Cor. 11:20.
In the preceding chapter he uses the word communion
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page164">[pg 164]</span><a name="Pg164" id="Pg164" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
when speaking of the same divinely originated ordinance.
<span class="tei tei-q">“The cup of blessing which we bless, is it
not the communion of the blood of Christ? The
bread which we break, is it not the communion of the
body of Christ?”</span> 1 Cor. 10:16.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The apostle in these texts is referring to an ordinance
of the New Testament instituted by the blessed
Savior just prior to his passion as recorded by the
writers of the gospels and observed by the church
when it was the light of the world. If this sacred and
very impressive ordinance was abolished at the death
of the Savior, as some erroneously teach, why does
Paul more than a score of years after exhort Christians
to its observance and warn them so faithfully
against corrupting so sacred a rite, telling them that
if they eat and drink unworthily they eat and drink
damnation to themselves, and admonishing them to
examine themselves and so let them eat? 1 Cor. 11.
It must be clear to all unclouded, candid minds by the
reading of this chapter that there was an ordinance
solemnly observed by the Christians long after the
Savior was <span class="tei tei-q">“nailed to the cross.”</span> In very plain and
positive language he tells us that the communion or
Lord's Supper is a New Testament ordinance: <span class="tei tei-q">“This
cup is the New Testament in my blood.”</span> 1 Cor. 11:25.
This is corroborative of Mat. 26:28: <span class="tei tei-q">“For this
is my blood of the new testament;”</span> and of Mark
14:24: <span class="tei tei-q">“And he said unto them, This is my blood
of the new testament, which is shed for many.”</span> Also
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page165">[pg 165]</span><a name="Pg165" id="Pg165" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of Luke 22:20: <span class="tei tei-q">“Likewise also the cup after supper,
saying, This cup is the new testament in my blood,
which is shed for you.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
To one enjoying the full light of the precious gospel
to teach the abolition of this solemn ordinance
appears the very height of folly and ignorance. In
the recording of the Acts of the apostles it is said that
<span class="tei tei-q">“upon the first day of the week, when the disciples
came together to break bread, Paul preached unto
them.”</span> Acts 20:7. The breaking of bread as here
spoken of signifies nothing else but the observance of
the Lord's Supper.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The few plain, comprehensive texts of apostolic
teaching we have quoted upon this subject must make
obvious to the mind of the reader that Christians of
the morning time of this gospel day observed an
ordinance termed the Lord's Supper or communion,
done in remembrance of Jesus and showing his death
till he come. We will learn in the noontime's awful
darkness how the blinded minds and unregenerated
hearts of teachers by misunderstanding and misapplying
these plain texts caused their clear light to cease
to shine.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
True love manifests itself in many ways. We embrace
with the arms, we greet with a kiss, the object
of our love. We speak of these love tokens ofttimes
in a spiritual way: <span class="tei tei-q">“Folded in the arms of Jesus;”</span>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page166">[pg 166]</span><a name="Pg166" id="Pg166" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
<span class="tei tei-q">“Leaning on his breast;”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“Sheltered beneath his
wing.”</span> The Psalmist says, <span class="tei tei-q">“Kiss the Son, lest he
be angry.”</span> Psa. 2:12. These were literally practised
by the Savior and his beloved followers while he was
here. After Jesus arose and went to the Father the
apostles practised the holy kiss. <span class="tei tei-q">“They all wept
sore, and fell on Paul's neck, and kissed him.”</span> Acts
20:37. We behold the love they bore for him. It
was not a cold kiss of formality, but of love. In the
first verse we see the love Paul had for the disciples:
<span class="tei tei-q">“Paul called unto him the disciples and embraced
them.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In the epistolary law of the New Testament the
holy kiss is five times commanded. <span class="tei tei-q">“Salute one
another with a holy kiss.”</span> Rom. 16:16. <span class="tei tei-q">“Greet ye one
another with a holy kiss.”</span> 1 Cor. 16:20. <span class="tei tei-q">“Greet one
another with a holy kiss.”</span> 2 Cor. 13:12. <span class="tei tei-q">“Greet all
the brethren with a holy kiss.”</span> 1 Thes. 5:26.
<span class="tei tei-q">“Greet ye one another with a kiss of charity.”</span> 1 Pet.
5:14.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Satan ever ready to corrupt the pure precepts and
practises of the sacred Word has led people into
the disgraceful fanaticism of promiscuous kissing.
Such is not a kiss of love, but a kiss of lust. Everything
done in the order of the kingdom of heaven is
done in the perfection of decency and respectability.
How natural for the fond husband to embrace and
kiss the beloved wife, and the devoted mother her
child, the brother his sister, all because love exists consistent
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page167">[pg 167]</span><a name="Pg167" id="Pg167" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
with natural relation. But the strongest tie
of love that binds hearts together is the Christian love.
Then how natural and becoming for the Christian to
greet with a kiss his brother, and the Christian sister
her sister in the Lord.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Christian love continued after the apostles' days
were ended, and consequently the practise of greeting
with a holy kiss. We will conclude this subject by referring
the reader to history as quoted in <span class="tei tei-q">“Ordinances
of the New Testament”</span>: <span class="tei tei-q">“The fraternal kiss used on
admission to the church and at the Lord's Supper
were not empty forms, but the expression of a true
feeling, and of a real experience.”</span>—<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Butler's Ecclesiastical
History</span></span>, p. 132.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“After the prayers ... we greet one another with
the brotherly kiss.”</span>—<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Justin Martyr</span></span>, p. 146.

<span class="tei tei-q">“The communion was a regular part of the Sunday
worship. In many places it was celebrated daily. It

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In the olden time when the chosen children of God
were battling in the wilderness against their enemies,
as long as the hands of Moses were kept uplifted Israel
prevailed, and when his hands were let down the enemy
triumphed. Ex. 17:8-12. See also Psa. 28:2;
63:4; 88:9; Lam. 3:41. This signal act of triumph is
conveyed into the spirit of the New Testament. Paul
says, <span class="tei tei-q">“I will therefore that men pray everywhere,
lifting up holy hands, without wrath and doubting.”</span>
1 Tim. 2:8. This is a single text of the New Testament
teaching this ordinance. In connection with
this text some have used Heb. 12:12; but to our mind
it is only an exhortation to encourage the feeble and
faint-hearted, and not an express command to the
literally raising of the hands. However the one text
quoted is sufficient for those who love the Lord, for
those who love him keep his commandments.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This ceremony is suggestive of submissiveness and
reliance upon God. It is natural for the Spirit-born
child of God to imploringly lift his hands to God in
petition or praise and thanksgiving. In the time when
the spiritual battles wax hot we seek God in earnest
imploring prayer, and the lifting up of our hands
adds strength to our faith and draws God nearer.
But, oh, let us make sure that our hands and hearts
are holy. It is but mockery to spread forth your
hands unto God when they are full of blood. From

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
To the proud heart the commandment to <span class="tei tei-q">“wash one
another's feet”</span> is perhaps the most ridiculous ever
given by the Son of God. In the semi-theatrical
church entertainments men may pay a large sum for
the privilege of kissing the most handsome lady, and
for similar or more shameful indulgences, but to humbly
wash a brother's feet would be shocking in the
extreme. <span class="tei tei-q">“If a man love me he will keep my words.”</span>
John 14:23. Where true love exists there is no disposition
to spurn any of the Lord's commandments,
however humiliating they may be.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The ordinance of feet-washing was instituted by
the Savior, and is recorded in the thirteenth chapter
of John. One objection that many bring against this
sacred ordinance is that it is so seldom mentioned in
the Bible. If a man does not love God deeply enough
to obey him when he speaks but once, he would not
obey him should he speak a dozen times. Jesus says,
<span class="tei tei-q">“If they hear not Moses and the prophets, neither will
they be persuaded, though one rose from the dead.”</span>
Luke 16:31. It is never difficult to persuade a humble
heart to believe the Word of God, though there be
but one single commandment; but the proud in heart
will not be persuaded by any number if they are not
according to their inclinations. About the first objection
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page170">[pg 170]</span><a name="Pg170" id="Pg170" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
offered against this humble ordinance is that
it was a custom among the Jews to wash feet, and the
feet-washing recorded by John was nothing more than
the Jewish custom. There was more here than the
mere custom of washing feet.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
We will carefully weigh this objection. Bathing is
a custom, naturally so, for cleanliness and health, and
is observed by people of every civilized nation, and
has been in every age of the world. Pharaoh's daughter
went down to the river to bathe when she found
the babe in the ark of bulrushes. Ex. 2:5. Bathing
was not a custom of any particular nation, but a universal
custom. God separated Israel from the world
to be his own chosen people. He gave them certain
laws, which stood as a partition wall between them and
the Gentile world. Among the many ceremonies was
that of bathing. By reading the fifteenth chapter of
Leviticus you will learn of the bathings required of
the Jews for certain sins and uncleannesses. These
bathings were peculiar to this people alone and served
to separate them from other nations. They observed
the universal custom of bathing, but these bathings
were additional and given by the Lord. When Jesus
came he abolished the Jewish ordinances that distinguished
them from the world and offers salvation to
every nation. By his grace he separates his people
from the world and institutes for them the ordinance
of baptism. This is not the universal custom of bathing,
neither is it the Jewish ceremony of bathings for
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page171">[pg 171]</span><a name="Pg171" id="Pg171" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
cleansings, but a New Testament ordinance for saved
people of this gospel day, representing their death
to sin and consequent separation from the world. All
continue in the custom of bathing, but the Christian
is baptized.

All people in every age are accustomed, if we may
call it a custom, to eating; but when God separated
Israel from Egypt and gave them a law, he instituted
a supper called the Passover. This they kept in commemoration
of their deliverance from Egyptian bondage.
The Passover supper was not the mere custom of
eating supper, but was an ordinance peculiar to the
Jewish nation, and served to distinguish them as God's
own chosen people. In Heb. 9:10 we learn that these
meats and drinks, and divers washings, and carnal
ordinances, were imposed on them until the time of
reformation. When Jesus came he instituted a new
order of things. The Passover supper was with the
rest of the Jewish ordinances blotted out and nailed
to the cross. Col. 2:14. Jesus instituted a supper
to be kept in remembrance of him by his peculiar,
exclusive people. This consists of bread, which represents
his body, and of wine, which represents his
blood. This is not the custom of eating, neither is it
the Jewish ordinance, but a newly instituted ordinance
in this dispensation of grace. All continue the
custom of eating, but Christians keep the communion.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
When Abraham was in the plains of Mamre he was
visited by three angels, unto whom he said: <span class="tei tei-q">“Let a little
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page172">[pg 172]</span><a name="Pg172" id="Pg172" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
water, I pray you, be fetched, and wash your feet,
and rest yourselves under the tree.”</span> Gen. 18:4. Two
angels came one evening to Sodom, and Lot rose up
to meet them, and said: <span class="tei tei-q">“Behold now, my lords, turn
in, I pray you, into your servant's house, and tarry
all night, and wash your feet.”</span> Gen. 19:1, 2. By
these instances and others we understand that washing
feet was a custom in that time. It was not a law
of God, but people of all nations observed it as a law
of health, comfort, and cleanliness.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In Ex. 30:19-21 and 40:30-32 we learn that God
instituted an ordinance or ceremony of washing feet.
This was not the mere custom of washing feet, but
was a Jewish rite and served among other rites and
ceremonies to distinguish them as God's own peculiar
people. When the Son of God set up the kingdom of
grace, this priestly ceremony was blotted out and a
new ordinance of feet-washing was instituted. See
John 13. This was not the ancient universal custom
of washing feet. That still continues the same as eating
and bathing. It is not the Jewish ordinance, because
they were all nailed to the cross; but it is a humble
ordinance the Savior instituted for his people
saved from sin in this blessed gospel day. The Lord's
people love this precious ordinance. Jesus set the example
and intends his own to do as he did. <span class="tei tei-q">“If I
then, your Lord and Master, have washed your feet;
ye also ought to wash one another's feet. For I
have given you an example, that ye should do as I
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page173">[pg 173]</span><a name="Pg173" id="Pg173" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
have done to you.”</span> John 13:14, 15. Jesus set the
example in baptism and intends for us to follow.
Mat. 3:15, 16. He set the example in partaking of
his newly instituted supper and intends for us to
walk in his steps. 1 Cor. 11:25.

Since the word <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">ought</span></em> is used some appear to rejoice
in the thought that it is not obligatory. I, for
one, ever since the Lord made me a Christian, have
always been willing and glad to do just what I <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">ought</span></em>
to do. We scarcely think a man loves God when he
refuses to do what he knows he ought to do. <span class="tei tei-q">“Ye

always to pray.”</span> Luke 18:1. <span class="tei tei-q">“We ought also to
love one another.”</span> 1 John 4:11. <span class="tei tei-q">“Ye also ought to

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The thirty-fifth chapter of Isaiah is a prophecy
beautifully extolling the glories and virtues of Christ's
redemptive works. <span class="tei tei-q">“The desert shall rejoice and
blossom as the rose.”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“It shall blossom abundantly,
and rejoice even with joy and singing: the glory of
Lebanon shall be given unto it, the excellency of Carmel
and Sharon, they shall see the glory of the Lord,
and the excellency of our God.... Then the eyes of
the blind shall be opened, and the ears of the deaf shall
be unstopped. Then shall the lame man leap as an
hart, and the tongue of the dumb sing.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In Isaiah sixty-one, is another prophecy of the Savior:
<span class="tei tei-q">“The Spirit of the Lord God is upon me; because
the Lord hath anointed me to preach good tidings
unto the meek; he hath sent me to bind up the
broken-hearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives,
and the opening of the prison to them that are bound;
to proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord.”</span> Isa. 61:1, 2.
Where this text is quoted in the New Testament,
there is added, <span class="tei tei-q">“and recovering of sight to the blind.”</span>
Luke 4:18. This addition is found in the LXX.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Again the prophet speaking of Christ said, <span class="tei tei-q">“But he
was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised
for our iniquities: the chastisement of our peace was
upon him; and with his stripes we are healed.”</span> Isa.
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page175">[pg 175]</span><a name="Pg175" id="Pg175" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
53:5. The evangelist in speaking of the prophecy of
Isa. 53:4, 5, says, <span class="tei tei-q">“When the even was come they
brought unto him many that were possessed with
devils: and he cast out the spirits with his word, and
healed all that were sick; that it might be fulfilled
which was spoken by Esaias the prophet, saying, Himself
took our infirmities, and bare our sicknesses.”</span>
Mat. 8:16, 17. In verse thirteen is recorded the healing
of the centurion's servant: <span class="tei tei-q">“Go thy way, and as
thou hast believed, so be it done unto thee. And his
servant was healed in the selfsame hour.”</span> When
Jesus saw the mother of Peter's wife lying sick of a
fever, he touched her hand and the fever left her,
and she arose and ministered unto them. Ver. 14, 15.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In the ninth chapter of Matthew is recorded the
instance of the healing of the man sick of the palsy,
and of a woman who had been diseased for twelve
years, and of the raising to life of the daughter of a
certain ruler; also the restoring of the sight of two
blind men. Jesus saith unto them, <span class="tei tei-q">“Believe ye that I
am able to do this? They said unto him, Yea, Lord.
Then touched he their eyes, saying, According to your
faith be it unto you. And their eyes were opened.”</span>
<span class="tei tei-q">“And Jesus went about all the cities and villages,
teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the gospel
of the kingdom, and healing every sickness and
every disease among the people.”</span> Ver. 35.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
John, when in prison, hearing of the works of Jesus,
sent two of his disciples who asked the Savior, <span class="tei tei-q">“Art
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page176">[pg 176]</span><a name="Pg176" id="Pg176" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
thou he that should come, or do we look for another?”</span>
Now John was acquainted with the prophecy of Isaiah
concerning the Christ, so Jesus said to the disciples,
<span class="tei tei-q">“Go and show John again those things which ye do
hear and see: the blind receive their sight and the
lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, and the deaf hear,
the dead are raised up, and the poor have the gospel
preached unto them.”</span> Jesus told them that he was doing
just what was prophesied that Christ should do
when he came, then this must certainly be he and
we need not look for another. Throughout his ministry
the Savior continued to cast out devils and to
heal the sick. He gave his twelve disciples power
<span class="tei tei-q">“against unclean spirits, to cast them out, and to heal
all manner of sickness and all manner of disease.”</span>
Mat. 10:1. Not only did he give the twelve such power
over Satan and sickness, but in sending out the
seventy he said: <span class="tei tei-q">“And into whatsoever city ye enter,
and they receive you, eat such things as are set
before you: and heal the sick that are therein, and
say unto them, The kingdom of God is come nigh
unto you.”</span> Luke 10:8, 9.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Before Jesus ascended to the Father he commissioned
his disciples to preach the gospel, saying, <span class="tei tei-q">“Go
ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every
creature. He that believeth and is baptized shall be
saved: but he that believeth not shall be damned. And
these signs shall follow them that believe: In my name
shall they cast out devils; they shall speak with new
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page177">[pg 177]</span><a name="Pg177" id="Pg177" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
tongues; they shall take up serpents; and if they
drink any deadly thing, it shall not hurt them; they
shall lay hands on the sick, and they shall recover.”</span>
Mark 16:15-18. Jesus was the <span class="tei tei-q">“light of the world,”</span>
because he had power over sin and disease. The
church becomes a light in the world in proportion to
her power and purity, and when she reaches the zenith
of her power the same power is exercised by her
as by the Lord himself. After commissioning the
disciples to preach, Jesus was <span class="tei tei-q">“received up into heaven,
and sat on the right hand of God. And they went
forth, and preached everywhere, the Lord working
with them, and confirming the word with signs following.”</span>
Mark 16:19, 20. Although Jesus had ascended
to heaven, yet it is said that he was working
with them as they preached the word. Here was the
secret of their power, <span class="tei tei-q">“workers together with God.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Again Jesus said, <span class="tei tei-q">“Go ye therefore, and teach all
nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father,
and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost: teaching them
to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded
you: and, lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end
of the world.”</span> Mat. 28:19, 20. The Lord here gives
promise to be with them unto the end. Although he
ascended, yet he says, <span class="tei tei-q">“I will not leave you comfortless:
I will come to you.”</span> John 14:18. The Holy
Spirit on the day of Pentecost came and dwelt in the
midst of God's church in the same authoritative power
over sin and demons that Christ exercised before
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page178">[pg 178]</span><a name="Pg178" id="Pg178" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
his passion. He now comes in the power of the Holy
Spirit, performing great deeds of wonder through
his church. The church only was visible, therefore
became the light of the world. After Pentecost the
disciples did as Jesus commanded. They began to
preach the gospel, and Jesus working with them, many
souls were saved. Peter and John on one occasion
<span class="tei tei-q">“went up together into the temple at the hour of
prayer, being the ninth hour. And a certain man
lame from his mother's womb was carried, whom they
laid daily at the gate of the temple which is called
Beautiful, to ask alms of them that entered into
the temple; who seeing Peter and John about to go
into the temple asked an alms. And Peter, fastening
his eyes on him with John, said, Look on us. And
he gave heed unto them, expecting to receive something
of them. Then Peter said, Silver and gold have
I none; but such as I have give I thee: in the name
of Jesus Christ of Nazareth rise up and walk. And
he took him by the right hand, and lifted him up;
and immediately his feet and ankle bones received
strength. And he leaping up stood, and walked, and
entered with them into the temple, walking, and leaping,
and praising God. And all the people saw him
walking and praising God.”</span> Acts 3:1-9. This miracle
of divine healing was done by faith in the name of
Jesus. Ver. 16. The Lord was with his disciples confirming
the preaching with signs following.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In the ninth chapter of Acts is recorded an instance
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page179">[pg 179]</span><a name="Pg179" id="Pg179" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of the dead being raised to life. Dorcas, who was a
good woman, was taken sick and died. Two men were
sent for Peter, who when he was come was brought
into the upper chamber: <span class="tei tei-q">“and all the widows stood
by him weeping, and showing the coats and garments
which Dorcas made while she was with them. But
Peter put them all forth, and kneeled down and
prayed: and turning him to the body said, Tabitha,
arise. And she opened her eyes: and when she saw
Peter she sat up. And he gave her his hand, and
lifted her up: and when he had called the saints and
the widows, presented her alive. And it was known
throughout all Joppa; and many believed in the
Lord.”</span> This was when the church was the light of
the world; when the whole pure gospel was preached
for the gospel's sake, and men lived humbly before
God, and were workers together with him.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Paul escaping the waves was cast upon the island
of Melita. He says, <span class="tei tei-q">“The barbarous people showed
us no little kindness; for they kindled a fire, and received
us every one, because of the present rain, and
because of the cold.”</span> And when he had gathered a
bundle of sticks, and laid them on the fire, there came
a viper out of the heat, and fastened on his hand.
And when the barbarians saw the venomous beast
hang on his hand, they said among themselves, No
doubt this man is a murderer, whom, though he hath
escaped the sea, yet vengeance suffereth not to live.
Acts 28:1-4. Now was the promise given in the commission
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page180">[pg 180]</span><a name="Pg180" id="Pg180" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
to prove true? Jesus said, <span class="tei tei-q">“They shall take
up serpents.”</span> Here Paul had taken one up. Should
he trust in the promise of the Savior, or resort to some
antidote? It is said, He shook off the beast into the
fire and felt no harm. The natives were astonished
and God was glorified. Had Paul sought and obtained
relief by medical means, whatever brought the relief
would have been worthy the praise. He was living
solely for the glory of God, and by trusting in God
and God protecting him it was thus that God was
glorified.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The <span class="tei tei-q">“gifts of healing”</span> were placed in the church.
See 1 Cor. 12:28. As late as the year 60 A.D., twenty-seven
years after the Lord had ascended, James
tells us what to do when sick. He says, <span class="tei tei-q">“Is any among
you afflicted? let him pray. Is any merry? let him
sing psalms. Is any sick among you? let him call for
the elders of the church; and let them pray over
him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord:
and the prayer of faith shall save the sick, and the
Lord shall raise him up; and if he have committed
sins, they shall be forgiven him.”</span> Jas. 5:13-15.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Thus the Lord worked in the midst of his people
in the morning of the gospel day. He gave them
grace and power to live the same holy, humble life
he lived. He gave them power to cast out devils and
to heal the sick. By performing the works and living
the life of Jesus the church was a city set upon
a hill, which could not be hid—a light in the world.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The Son of God in his beautiful narrative of the
rich man and Lazarus certainly teaches a conscious
existence of the departed souls of both the wicked and
the righteous. The soul of the rich man was in torment
in the flames of hell. The angels carried the
poor beggar to rest and bliss in Abraham's bosom.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“There was a certain rich man, which was clothed
in purple and fine linen, and fared sumptuously every
day: and there was a certain beggar named Lazarus,
which was laid at his gate, full of sores, and
desiring to be fed with the crumbs which fell from the
rich man's table: moreover the dogs came and licked
his sores. And it came to pass, that the beggar died,
and was carried by the angels into Abraham's bosom:
the rich man also died, and was buried; and in hell
he lifted up his eyes, being in torments, and seeth
Abraham afar off, and Lazarus in his bosom. And he
cried and said, Father Abraham, have mercy on me,
and send Lazarus, that he may dip the tip of his
finger in water, and cool my tongue; for I am tormented
in this flame. But Abraham said, Son, remember
that thou in thy lifetime receivedst thy good
things, and likewise Lazarus evil things: but now he
is comforted, and thou art tormented. And beside all
this, between us and you there is a great gulf fixed:
so that they which would pass from hence to you
can not; neither can they pass to us, that would come
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page185">[pg 185]</span><a name="Pg185" id="Pg185" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
from thence. Then he said, I pray thee therefore, father,
that thou wouldest send him to my father's
house: for I have five brethren; that he may testify
unto them, lest they also come into this place of
torment. Abraham saith unto him, They have Moses
and the prophets; let them hear them. And he said,
Nay, father Abraham: but if one went unto them
from the dead, they will repent. And he said unto
him, If they hear not Moses and the prophets, neither
will they be persuaded, though one rose from the
dead.”</span> Luke 16:19-31.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The immortal soul of man is a conscious entity,
whether in sin or in righteousness. If in righteousness,
there is a blessed consciousness of peace, rest,
and contentment. This internal sense of happiness
man enjoyed in his primeval state. By disobedience
an awful change came over him, by which the peaceful
rest and full satisfaction of the soul was destroyed,
and the terrible miseries of sin were experienced.
In sin the soul still retains its consciousness.
There is in fallen man an internal knowledge of incompleteness.
There is a missing link, an awful
vacancy, and a kind of intuitive knowledge that he
must give answer for certain moral responsibilities
unto a great Creator. There are deep longings,
restless fears, dark uncertainties, and desperate strugglings
for a satisfactory hope.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
By the entrance of sin into the world there was implanted
in the nature of man a <span class="tei tei-q">“lust of the flesh,”</span>
which seeks the pleasures of the world. This never
brings contentment to the soul. It reaches to something
far beyond for rest. Jesus came to this world
as the soul's Rest-giver. <span class="tei tei-q">“Come unto me, all ye that
labor and are heavy-laden, and I will give you rest.
Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am
meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto
your souls.”</span> Mat. 11:28, 29. The name of Jesus is
sweet to the soul whose cry is not stifled by the <span class="tei tei-q">“lusts
of the flesh.”</span> It is the disposition of the <span class="tei tei-q">“carnal
mind”</span> to hush the pleadings of the hungry, thirsting
spirit by bidding it wait until some future time when
its demands will be given attention. The <span class="tei tei-q">“flesh”</span>
gains its pleasures at the cost of the soul's rest, and
when the soul gains rest it must be at the cost of the
lust of the flesh, and thus the war goes on between the
flesh and the spirit. How often in the days of one's
youth the soul struggles hard for freedom and pleads
for rest; the <span class="tei tei-q">“flesh”</span> quiets its fears by promising to
yield to its desires in maturer years. Old age comes
on, and the flesh, unwilling yet to make a sacrifice of
the world, bids the restless soul to hope for joy in
heaven.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This delusive scheme often proves a success, allowing
the flesh to go on reaping its carnal lusts with the
soul endeavoring to satisfy itself with the hope of
rest above. It is true there are wondrous joys in
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page187">[pg 187]</span><a name="Pg187" id="Pg187" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
heaven, but it is not all who shall get to enjoy them.
It is very dangerous and delusive to encourage the
heart to hope for a home in heaven when the flesh
still loves this world. Bright hopes of endless glory
in the world above cheer us on amid the storms of
life to that precious goal, but we would not desire you
to pass through this world heavy-laden, with a hope
of unloading your cargo of sorrow and pain somewhere
in the beyond and being happy there. As we
cross the ocean of life, there is to be found a blessed
port where you can discharge your load of sin and
sorrow and take on joys to your vessel's full capacity.
Beyond life's sail there remains no port of exchange.
The soul fitted for the delights of heaven, enjoys
heavenly delights in this world. In the divine economy
there is a sufficiency of grace to enable the soul to be
blessedly at rest amid the most trying circumstances
of life. When our happy spirits, no longer holden
by the house of clay, shall soar away to heavenly
rest, scenes and experiences will arise of such a nature
as to greatly enhance the felicity of our hearts,
but the revelation of heaven upon a pardoned soul,

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Happiness forever—these words sound sweet and
dear to almost every heart. There is nothing repulsive
in their tone, but, oh, what strength they give
to the weary, waiting soul. The hope of never-ending
happiness in a bright celestial world enables us to
patiently endure the tortures and afflictions of this
sin-cursed, terrestrial sphere. It is not difficult to
persuade most people that somewhere in the great
beyond there is a place of peace and bliss, prepared
for the children of God to inhabit forever. But few
men have disposition of spirit to wrest the clear declarations
of inspiration on this delightful theme.
Perhaps no other subject in the Bible is so universally
received. Eternal rest to the Christian is the voice
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page189">[pg 189]</span><a name="Pg189" id="Pg189" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of the Word forever settled in heaven. Oh, how our
hearts glow with rapture and our bosoms heave with
waves of love and praise to God as we by faith look
into an eternity of perfect bliss prepared for us.
<span class="tei tei-q">“Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom
prepared for you from the foundation of the world.”</span>
Mat. 25:34. <span class="tei tei-q">“Well done, thou good and faithful
servant, enter thou into the joy of thy Lord.”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“In thy
presence is fulness of joy; at thy right hand there are
pleasures forevermore.”</span> Psa. 16:11. <span class="tei tei-q">“The righteous
shall go away into eternal life.”</span> Mat. 25:46. <span class="tei tei-q">“Then
we which are alive and remain shall be caught up
together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord
in the air; and so shall we ever be with the Lord.”</span>
1 Thes. 4:17.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
These few texts are sufficient to convince the reader
that there is a heaven of eternal joys, but before
leaving this subject we will give one text of caution.
<span class="tei tei-q">“Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall
enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth
the will of my Father which is in heaven.”</span> Mat. 7:21.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Misery, wretchedness and woe forever—these words
have an unpleasant sound. They form no enjoyable
theme for meditation. People usually reject all
thoughts of eternal unhappiness. Because of its unpleasantness
many have sought to explain the doctrine
away. However it is as positively declared in
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page190">[pg 190]</span><a name="Pg190" id="Pg190" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the sacred volume as the doctrine of eternal happiness.
<span class="tei tei-q">“And these shall go away into everlasting
punishment: but the righteous into life eternal.”</span>
Mat. 25:46. The punishment of the wicked in duration
is equal with the life of the righteous, but some,
who no doubt have not been rescued from the fears
of hell, have endeavored to make the words everlasting
and eternal as used in the above texts differ in
meaning with respect to time.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Upon this subject we will quote from the treatise
entitled, <span class="tei tei-q">“What Is the Soul?”</span> by D. S. Warner:
<span class="tei tei-q">“The words <span class="tei tei-q">‘eternal life,’</span> as the great gift of God
to men, occur in the New Testament just twenty-nine
times, and in every instance the word eternal is
derived from the Greek word <span lang="el" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="el"><span style="font-style: italic">aionios</span></span>;
the same word which tells how long the punishment of the wicked
shall last in Mat. 25:46, and elsewhere. The words
<span class="tei tei-q">‘everlasting life’</span> and <span class="tei tei-q">‘life everlasting’</span> occur in
the New Testament fourteen times, and by reference
to the Greek Testament you will find the word everlasting
is, without a single exception, translated from
the same Greek word—<span lang="el" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="el"><span style="font-style: italic">aionios</span></span>.
Here then we learn the wisdom of Heaven finds and uses no stronger term in
all the forty-three promises and statements of eternal
and everlasting life to the righteous in the New Testament
than the word <span lang="el" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="el"><span style="font-style: italic">aionion</span></span>, the very same word
which he uses to declare the eternal and everlasting
punishment of the wicked.... The Lord Jesus
Christ and the Holy Spirit have described the duration
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page191">[pg 191]</span><a name="Pg191" id="Pg191" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of their own existence, attributes and glory by
the use of the same word which we have seen fixes
the eternal punishment of the wicked.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“In Heb. 5:9 we read that Christ became the author
of <span class="tei tei-q">‘eternal [<span lang="el" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="el"><span style="font-style: italic">aionion</span></span>] salvation unto all
them that obey him.’</span> If therefore this word does not
mean eternal, our salvation will finally fail and drop
us back into the hands of the devil. In Heb. 9:12
we read that Christ has obtained eternal
(<span lang="el" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="el"><span style="font-style: italic">aionion</span></span>)
redemption. If then the word only means a long
period of time our eternal redemption is not yet
secured. In Heb. 9:15 we are told that by means of
Christ's death for our redemption, we have <span class="tei tei-q">‘received the promise of
eternal [<span lang="el" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="el"><span style="font-style: italic">aionion</span></span>] inheritance.’</span> Will
the inheritance that Christ has purchased by his death
come to an end?”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In speaking of hell-fire in the ninth chapter of the gospel by Mark the
eternal—<span lang="el" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="el"><span style="font-style: italic">aionion</span></span>—immortal Son
of God five times says it is a fire <span class="tei tei-q">“which is not”</span>
and <span class="tei tei-q">“never shall be quenched.”</span> If it never shall be
quenched, can we possibly err in supposing that it
will burn forever? <span class="tei tei-q">“Then shall he say also unto them
on the left hand, Depart from me, ye cursed, into
everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels.”</span>
Mat. 25:41. <span class="tei tei-q">“And shall be tormented day
and night forever and ever.”</span> Rev. 20:10. <span class="tei tei-q">“And the
smoke of their torment ascendeth up forever and
ever.”</span> Rev. 14:11.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
There are yet many other scriptures which positively
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page192">[pg 192]</span><a name="Pg192" id="Pg192" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
teach everlasting punishment in an endless
hell. Whatever fears this doctrine may bring to
deluded souls, and however zealously they may labor
for its refutation, it stands unshaken. If you fear
eternal punishment do not endeavor to calm your
fears by seeking to believe there is no endless torment,
but seek the Savior, who will save you from
your sins and fears, and give you hope, blessed hope,
of everlasting peace and rest.

<span class="tei tei-q">“And this is the record, that God hath given to us
eternal life, and this life is in his Son.”</span> 1 John 5:11.
There is eternal life in Jesus, but for man to come
into possession of this life he must comply with the
requirements made by the Bible. After getting into
possession of this life there are certain duties which
man must faithfully perform to retain and develop it.
After entering the wide fields of grace development
is necessary. <span class="tei tei-q">“But grow in grace, and in the knowledge
of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.”</span> 2 Pet.
3:18. Nutrition necessary for the development of
spiritual life is contained in the Word of God. <span class="tei tei-q">“Man
shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that
proceedeth out of the mouth of God.”</span> Mat. 4:4.
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page193">[pg 193]</span><a name="Pg193" id="Pg193" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
<span class="tei tei-q">“As new-born babes, desire the sincere milk of the
word, that ye may prow thereby.”</span> 1 Pet. 2:2.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
By proper culture—attending to Christian duties—the
Christ-life in the soul will be strengthened, and
daily we will become stronger in faith, richer in virtue,
deeper in knowledge, more strictly temperate,
exercise a greater degree of brotherly kindness and
godliness, and enjoy more of heaven's pure love in
our hearts. Neglect the proper Scriptural culture
of the spiritual life and the Christian will degenerate
into a few irksome duties of cold formality. By the
writers of the New Testament we are urgently exhorted,
yea, commanded, to attend to certain duties
necessary to keep us in the love of God. Of these
especially important are reading the Scripture,
prayer, fasting, examination, meditation, etc.

better unto me than thousands of gold and silver.”</span>
Psa. 119:140, 127, 72. The Bible, to the Christian,
is a richer treasure than gold. No other book is read
with such deep, amazing interest. The soul ravishingly
feasts upon the pure, simple truth. It is manna.
It is life. <span class="tei tei-q">“How sweet are thy words unto my taste!

as to make death preferable to separation. <span class="tei tei-q">“O how

sufficient instructions and corrections to properly develop
the Christ-life in the soul, if it is heeded. By
looking into this perfect law of God and continuing
in its teaching one will imbibe its spirit, its life, its
power, until his own life will reveal the truly high

The Bible tells us of heaven, the eternal, happy
home of the righteous. It tells us of sin and how
it deprives the soul the privilege of entering that
bright mansion of everlasting rest. It tells of a
Savior who saves from sin, and fits and prepares
man to receive from God's hands great eternal rewards.
It unfolds to us the beautiful character of
God and encourages our souls to imitate his perfect
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page195">[pg 195]</span><a name="Pg195" id="Pg195" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
example. It speaks of our Heavenly Father's loving
providence, how that he is ever watching over us,
and guiding us with his eye; how that no harm shall
ever befall us, and when we pass through the rivers
they shall not overflow us; when we walk through the
fire we shall not be burned; how that he will withhold
no good thing from us, but will cause all things to
work for our good; how that he bears our burdens and
shelters us beneath his wing. The Bible is the Christian's
guide to a haven of rest; to make sure he is traveling
in the right course, he must study it well. He
must run the way of its commandments. To be a fruitful
Christian he must search it and be a doer of its
precepts, ever gaining knowledge and practising what
he knows. Ah, my Bible! it is a lamp unto my feet
and a light unto my pathway.

Prayer to be effectual must be offered, in faith.
The prayer of faith has accomplished wonders in

quenched the violence of fire, and escaped the

have become strong and turned to flight the armies
of the aliens. The weak child of God by prayer
develops into strong manhood. When engaged in
a severe contest with the enemy of your soul the
prayer of faith draws upon the strength of heaven
and thus you become stronger in God. In a time of
heavy and sore trials by looking upward unto God
in confidence we conquer. For this reason the trial
of our faith is more precious than gold. <span class="tei tei-q">“What

in my name, I will do it.”</span> John 14:13, 14. <span class="tei tei-q">“Hitherto
have ye asked nothing in my name: ask, and ye
shall receive, that your joy may be full.”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“And
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page197">[pg 197]</span><a name="Pg197" id="Pg197" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
whatsoever we ask, we receive of him, because we
keep his commandments, and do those things that
are pleasing in his sight.”</span> 1 John 3:22.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
With these promises before us we certainly ought
to be encouraged to strive earnestly for the faith
once delivered to the saints. It is the prayer of
faith that moves God upon his throne. Words offered
in mere form are powerless. <span class="tei tei-q">“He that cometh to
God must believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder
of them that diligently seek him,”</span> for <span class="tei tei-q">“without
faith it is impossible to please him.”</span> Heb. 11:6.
Man that asks of God and wavers in his faith is
compared to the restless waves of the sea. <span class="tei tei-q">“But
let him ask in faith, nothing wavering. For he that
wavereth is like a wave of the sea driven of the
wind and tossed. For let not that man think that
he shall receive anything of the Lord.”</span> Jas. 1:6, 7.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
There is a difference between simple faith and presumption.
Some people take things for granted because
God has promised similar things, without considering
well if their prayer is according to the will
of God. The Lord has promised bodily healing to
his children. He says, <span class="tei tei-q">“The prayer of faith shall save
the sick, and the Lord shall raise him up; and if he
have committed sins, they shall be forgiven him.”</span>
Jas. 5:15. This is conditional, the conditions being
recorded in the following verse: <span class="tei tei-q">“Confess your faults
one to another, and pray one for another, that ye may
be healed.”</span> The glorious Bible doctrine of divine
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page198">[pg 198]</span><a name="Pg198" id="Pg198" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
healing has many times been disgraced by mere presumption.
Many when they are anointed presume
they are healed because God has promised it in his
Word when they have failed to sit in the valley of
humiliation to learn of God their faults that need
correction. They find in a short time that their presumption
does not prove effectual and witnesses are
made to scorn the idea of divine healing. We hear of
no relapsing in a few days of those who were healed
by the Lord and his church in the morning light.
If any had such severe trials of faith as to be as
sick or worse than ever apparently, it was thought
wisdom to exclude such testimony from the Bible,
and if wise to exclude it from the Bible, we are persuaded
it is wise to exclude it from public testimony
at any time.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The same may be said of prayers for spiritual and
temporal blessings. Never mistake presumption for
faith. An individual might ask God for some temporal
blessing and because God has promised to
supply <span class="tei tei-q">“all our needs,”</span> and if <span class="tei tei-q">“we ask anything he
will do it,”</span> take it for granted he is soon going to
receive it, and when it fails to appear is disappointed
and discouraged. By close examination it will be
found that there was not a humble resignation of all
things into the hands of God. The prayer was
tinctured with selfish desire and more presuming than
heart-felt faith. For a perfect operation of faith
that will draw blessings and life and power from
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page199">[pg 199]</span><a name="Pg199" id="Pg199" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
God to the soul there must be a humble yielding, a
perfect surrender of all to the Father's loving control.
When all is resigned, and we sit in holy submission
at his feet, faith will spring up, and if it is
for some temporal blessing we are asking, God will
answer to the soul and we will know and feel within us
that we have the object desired. Though we have it
not as yet in our possession it will never fail to appear
at God's own appointed time, which is never too late.
We believe that many presume that they are sanctified,
but afterwards discover that they have not a
perfect and pure heart. In all probability there
was a lack in the consecration, which hindered a perfect
operation of faith, and presumption was mistaken
for belief. Such has doubtless been the result
also in seeking justification. Positive faith affects
God on his throne and brings a clear understanding
consciousness to the soul.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Some one may wonder in what way the prayer of
faith offered when we are sick, or prayers for temporal
needs can advantage us in the development of
spiritual life. God has so arranged that the prayer
of faith that brings healing virtue to the afflicted body
also brings a blessing and an increase to the soul.
Prayer that reaches God in a time of temporal need
not only moves him to grant the petition, but also
adds new strength and energy to the inner being. Thus
God may permit us to be afflicted or to be in great
need of food or raiment to awaken our souls to earnest
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page200">[pg 200]</span><a name="Pg200" id="Pg200" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
imploring prayer for our spiritual advantage. When
all is dark before and behind us, when storm-clouds
hang heavy over us and temptations grow manifold,
we are made keenly conscious that our whole and only
dependence is upon God. Then on wings of faith the
trembling soul comes into God's majestic presence to
implore his aid, his help, in time of need. In his fatherly
care he extends his hand and lifts us above the
storm-clouds of affliction and temptation into beautiful
light. It will be found that our soul is wonderfully
increased in God. Thus prayer offered in these
times of greatest need always prove a blessing to the
spiritual life. Our own dear children could save
themselves from much chastisement by obedience.
Thus the children of God would doubtless be spared
many an affliction if they were more strictly obedient
to him.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
How often should we pray? David says, <span class="tei tei-q">“Evening,
and morning, and at noon, will I pray, and cry aloud:
and he shall hear my voice.”</span> Psa. 55:17. Again he
says, <span class="tei tei-q">“Seven times a day do I praise thee because
of thy righteous judgments.”</span> Psa. 119:164. The
apostle Paul exhorts us to <span class="tei tei-q">“pray without ceasing.”</span>
1 Thes. 5:17. We do not understand by this last
text that the Christian is to be constantly in an
attitude of prayer. No one can reasonably demand
such a strict interpretation. For constant spiritual
growth we should follow the example of the holy
prophets and apostles and have regular daily visits
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page201">[pg 201]</span><a name="Pg201" id="Pg201" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
to our altar of prayer. Beside this if you desire the
beautiful character of Christ to unfold in your soul
and life you should be careful to constantly maintain
a prayerful frame of spirit. How often one should
go within their closet, circumstances must decide.
Where circumstances afford much time for prayer we
assure you to be no loser by living much behind your
closed door.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The spiritual man may be compared to the physical
man in a sense, or to a certain extent. The physical
man demands food for its sustenance. It feasts at the
breakfast table, then goes, using the strength derived
in performing the vocations of life. In a few hours
there will be a demand for more, as the force of the
former meal is spent. <span class="tei tei-q">“But man shall not live by
bread alone.”</span> The soul feasts upon the life of God
in prayer and is strengthened, you then engage in the
duties of life. In a short time you will feel the pangs
of hunger in your soul. There is a longing for a deep
communion with God. This is your best guide
as to how often you should pray if your soul is in a
good healthy state. It may not be convenient for you
to go into your closet every time you feel your soul
<span class="tei tei-q">“panting after God,”</span> but you can lift up your heart
to him in the best manner you can under the circumstances,
and then go and feast at your private altar
at your very earliest convenience.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The physical and spiritual man differ with respect
to overeating. Too much food is injurious to the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page202">[pg 202]</span><a name="Pg202" id="Pg202" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
animal man, but the danger of surfeiting was not
spoken of the soul. The inner man may feast and
banquet and drink of spiritual stores and streams and
the soul will grow and develop accordingly. There
is but little danger of lingering too long at the feast.
There is much danger of famine while the Christian
as a citizen of this world has certain secular duties
to perform, yet amid these he communes and walks
with God. While he may be intellectually engaged
in the problems of life, the higher affections of his
soul live upon heavenly things. He thus drinks of
the refreshing dews of glory until the beauteous graces
of Christ are imbibed and infused throughout his very
existence and the holy image of God is seen upon him.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The effect of a prayer of faith is almost without
limit. By it Daniel shut the mouths of lions. The
Hebrews walked unhurt amid the flames. Elijah shut
up the heavens until it did not rain for more than
three years. The waters of the sea have been divided,
the walls of cities thrown down, armies turned to
flight, kingdoms subdued, the prison-doors opened,
the barren womb has become fruitful, the lame have
been made to walk, the deaf to hear, the blind to see,
the dead raised to life and the soul redeemed. Oh, the
wonders of prayer!
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Satan, knowing how disastrous to his kingdom is
the Christian's prayer of faith, will do all he can to
hinder. He will heap upon you duties of life; tell you
that you have no time for prayer. When you do pray
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page203">[pg 203]</span><a name="Pg203" id="Pg203" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
he will try to make your prayers hurried and insincere.
He will try to divert your attention when at
the altar of prayer. He will be constantly presenting
thoughts of secular duties. He will strive to make
your devotions formal and irksome. He will cast over
you a feeling of awful indifference and then advise
you not to pray until you feel more like it. He will
make the heavens appear as brass above you, and tell
you God does not hear you. Christian, you know by
the Word of God what is your duty. It is to pray.
Then pray you must. It is the language of the Bible.
Disregarding your feelings, pray. Disregarding the
suggestions of Satan, pray. As you value your soul,
pray, and <span class="tei tei-q">“pray without ceasing.”</span>

<h3 class="tei tei-head" style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 2.40em; margin-top: 2.40em"><span style="font-size: 120%">Fastings.</span></h3>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
That the apostle Paul considered fasting an excellent
means for spiritual development is evident
from his writings. He says that the ministers of God
should approve themselves by <span class="tei tei-q">“much patience, in
afflictions, in necessities, in distresses, in stripes, in
imprisonments, in tumults, in labors, in watchings, in
fastings.”</span> 2 Cor. 6:4, 5. In speaking of himself,
he says he was <span class="tei tei-q">“in weariness and painfulness, in
watchings often, in hunger and thirst, in fastings often.”</span>
2 Cor. 11:27. In Acts 27:33, we learn that
on the occasion of the shipwreck fourteen days were
spent in fasting. This is not the doing of penance
that the priests of mystic Babylon bind upon their
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page204">[pg 204]</span><a name="Pg204" id="Pg204" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
subjects, but the cheerful service of a humble, devoted
heart. God has not left this at the direction of man,
but it is alone at the dictation of the Holy Spirit.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
There is a secret power in fasting. It separates
us farther from self and deepens us in humility,
spirituality and reliance upon God. On occasions
where great faith was required, fastings were recommended
by the Savior. In speaking to his disciples
concerning the devils which possessed a child, he said,
<span class="tei tei-q">“This kind goeth not out but by prayer and fasting.”</span>
Mat. 17:21. When Paul and Barnabas were separated
by the Holy Spirit unto the work of the Lord,
after fasting and prayer hands were laid upon them
and they were sent away. When fasting, the mind
is clearer and the faith more active. It is a self-denial,
which has a tendency to develop the graces
of the Spirit.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It is said of a certain prophetess that dwelt in
Jerusalem in the days of our Savior's nativity, that
she departed not from the temple, but served God
with fastings and prayers night and day. Luke 2:36,
37.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The most spiritual Christians are ready to acknowledge
that fasting is an excellent means of drawing
us into a deeper and more intimate communion with
God. We scarcely think that any one will attain to
any great spiritual depth without fasting. When the
Christian's soul is burdened for this lost world it is
natural for him to unburden his soul to God in
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page205">[pg 205]</span><a name="Pg205" id="Pg205" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
fasting and prayer. How beautifully has the Lord
arranged all things in the kingdom of heaven! He
by his Spirit, lays a burden upon our heart for the
souls of lost mankind. This burden causes us to
seek God in fasting and prayer for these lost ones,
and our prayers move him to send forth his Spirit
to convict this world of sin. Thus it is arranged in
the economy of grace, and thus we can all be <span class="tei tei-q">“workers
together with him.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It is sad that comparatively so few know the value
of the sincere prayer of faith. Fasting and prayer affect
this whole world, and heaven and hell. Christian,
do not be sparing in them. Christians are few, but
there are enough of them upon the earth, that if all
were earnest in fasting and prayer this world would
be disturbed in her slumber and sinners be made to
fear before the wrath of God. To be unwilling to fast
when we feel the movings of God's Spirit upon us
to that end, is to soon become so dull and stupid spiritually
that we will have but little burden or concern
for perishing souls. If we want to walk with God
and have a deep concern for his cause and love for
lost mankind we must be self-denying and <span class="tei tei-q">“in fastings
often.”</span>

<h3 class="tei tei-head" style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 2.40em; margin-top: 2.40em"><span style="font-size: 120%">Trials And Temptations.</span></h3>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
You may wonder why we have arranged the subject
of <span class="tei tei-q">“Trials and Temptations”</span> in the chapter of
<span class="tei tei-q">“Spiritual Culture.”</span> It is because they are an excellent
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page206">[pg 206]</span><a name="Pg206" id="Pg206" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
means of our growth in divine things. <span class="tei tei-q">“All
things work together for good to them that love God.”</span>
Trials prove to be for our good in the spiritual life
if we will boldly and bravely meet them in Jesus'
name. We are encouraged by the apostle James to
count all temptations a joy. It is evident that the
apostle would not exhort us to count temptations a
joy if they were not for our good. The Bible tells us
there is a tempter. 1 Thes. 3:5. We also learn
from the sacred page that God does not tempt any
man. Jas. 1:13. Matthew tells us that the devil is
the tempter. Mat. 4:1. God permits Satan to try
and tempt us as we learn from Job's experience.
Satan can not tempt us beyond what God permits, and
God will not permit him to tempt us beyond what
we are able to bear. He does not permit one to be
tempted more than another, but we all have temptations
such as are common to man. 1 Cor. 10:13.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Jesus was tempted in every manner that man is
tempted, yet without sin. Heb. 4:15. Jesus was not
overcome by temptation, but he faithfully endured.
Because he was thus tempted and overcame, he knows
how to deliver the godly out of temptation. 2 Pet. 2:9.
Not only does he know how to deliver us out of
temptation, but he is fully able to do so. Heb.
2:18.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Temptations and trials are necessary in the Christian
life. But few people realize the value of temptation.
But few people, or perhaps none but what
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page207">[pg 207]</span><a name="Pg207" id="Pg207" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
would backslide if they did not have any trials. God
has so arranged it in the nature of Christianity or
spiritual life that in order for the soul to grow and
develop it must be tested and tried. Leaning upon
God in time of strong temptation only increases our
strength in God. Man would become independent of
God, however much he may think to the contrary, if
he had no trials and temptations. No true-hearted
Christian has trials only such as he needs. Peter
says, <span class="tei tei-q">“Wherein ye greatly rejoice, though now for a
season, if need be, ye are in heaviness through manifold
temptations.”</span> 1 Pet. 1:6. Christian, do you not
value your spiritual prosperity above all else? Then
never complain nor become discouraged because of the
heavy and manifold temptations. God knows how to
deal with you. You may sometimes think you know
best, but in this you are mistaken. Father knoweth
best. He loves you and will not suffer you to be
tempted beyond what your needs are, and what he
will enable you to bear, if you will but trust in him.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
When your way grows very dark and temptation's
billows roll high, when the flames of fiery trials seem
to almost consume your soul, will you not remember
that just as you are being tempted, Jesus was also
tempted, yet he was not overcome? Also remember
that he knows how to deliver you, and is able to do
it. God sees that you need this and he is permitting
it to mold you and fashion you into his own holy
image. These are the refining flames that serve to
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page208">[pg 208]</span><a name="Pg208" id="Pg208" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
consume the dross and make you perfectly pure. Our
heavenly Father chasteneth us for our profit, that we
might be partakers of his holiness. Heb. 12:10. God
has given us a promise, which, if you will remember in
faith, will enable you to endure. <span class="tei tei-q">“Blessed is the
man that endureth temptation: for when he is tried
he shall receive a crown of life, which the Lord has
promised to them that love him.”</span> Jas. 1:12.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
That meditation does affect one's spirituality
is an unquestionable fact. Vagrant thought is well
calculated to dull the finer sensibilities of the soul,
thereby rendering it less capable of impression by
the Spirit of God. <span class="tei tei-q">“Keeping in touch with God,”</span>
is a very familiar expression among holiness people
at this present time, but what does it imply? We
are all at sea when not in touch with him. To be
so kept is to have everything in us fully alive to
God. Every Christian grace must be in a state of
perfect health and vigorous growth. If there be any
dwarfed condition of the spiritual being in any part
it will be less sensible to God's touch.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The blind have been known to cultivate the sense
of touch in the physical being to the amazing acuteness
of being able to distinguish color. The sense of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page209">[pg 209]</span><a name="Pg209" id="Pg209" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
touch in the soul by careful, earnest husbandry can
be refined to such a degree as to make it susceptible
to the slightest impression of the Holy Spirit.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In the creation, the moral being was given the capability
of being influenced and controlled by the Spirit
of the Lord. By sin this electric current from
God's presence to man's soul, like the separation of
the Atlantic cable, was divided. Man becoming thus
disconnected from God's power and impressive guidance
was left to be operated by the influences of a
wicked world. Through the redemptive power of
Jesus' blood man is again brought into union with
God. The divided cable is taken up and united, and
man's soul wondrously animated by God's presence.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
So cultured may become the sensibilities of the
inner being, and so thoroughly impregnated by God's
enlivening power, that one empty thought, causing
the slightest ebbing of life's current flow is keenly
felt. To keep in perfect touch with God is to live
where there is a soul consciousness that he is pleased
with every act of life; where there is a witnessing
<span class="tei tei-q">“sweet and clear”</span> of the Spirit to the inmost soul
that the words of your mouth and the meditations
of your heart are acceptable unto him.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Pure and holy meditations are an excellent means
for the culture and refinement of man's moral being.
Useless thought makes the soul coarse, and difficult of
impression by good influences. By associating with
God through prayer and meditation man's spiritual
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page210">[pg 210]</span><a name="Pg210" id="Pg210" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
entity will develop into his own glorious image. By
communion with the Lord his pure character is assimilated
into our own until our lives become but
the fruit of a vine which has its origin in the rich
soil around Heaven's throne. If you can indulge a
train of careless, vagabond thought, and not be severely
smitten in conscience, you are far from being
in touch with God. The spiritual depression and
awful benumbing stupidity, the disrelish for prayer
and reading the Bible, is often the result of entertaining
empty, fruitless meditations. The Scriptures
tell us what are wholesome subjects for thought, and
what are not. <span class="tei tei-q">“The thought of foolishness is sin.”</span>
Prov. 24:9. <span class="tei tei-q">“I hate vain thoughts.”</span> Psa. 119:113.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Vain and foolish thoughts are very destructive to
spirituality, and should be hated and carefully guarded
against by every lover of God's law. Many people
find it difficult to stay their mind upon the Lord.
While reading the Bible and in secret prayer their
thoughts are disposed to wander. The wonderful
works of God scarcely awaken any admiration within
them. They can not elevate their soul into a profound
awe before his awful presence, and there is
but little conscious depth of inner reverence and devotion
to his dear name. There is a blessed remedy
for this serious trouble. Carefully watch your meditations.
Call the oftener upon God in some silent
secret place. Select some secluded, hallowed place
for meditation. It is said of Isaac that he went into
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page211">[pg 211]</span><a name="Pg211" id="Pg211" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the field at eventide to meditate. Gen. 24:63. This
is a time well suited to draw the soul out into deep,
intimate communion with God. Learn to admire the
wondrous works of the Creator. Meditate upon them.
The setting of the sun, the starry heavens, the fleecy
floating clouds, the silent hills, all will serve to fill
your soul with reverential fear before God's majestic
presence, and all within you be awed to solemn stillness
at his footfall. Then you can say with the
Psalmist, <span class="tei tei-q">“O how love I thy law! it is my meditation
all the day.”</span> Psa. 119:97. <span class="tei tei-q">“I will remember the
works of the Lord: surely I will remember thy wonders
of old. I will meditate also of all thy work, and
talk of thy doings.”</span> Psa. 77:11, 12. <span class="tei tei-q">“My soul shall
be satisfied as with marrow and fatness; and my
mouth shall praise thee with joyful lips: when I remember
thee upon my bed, and meditate on thee
in the night watches.”</span> Psa. 63:5, 6.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Idle, careless thoughts generate a stupidity that
will rob you of joy and soul satisfaction. It will
deaden the sensibilities of your inner nature and prevent
your hearing God's footstep, and deprive you of
many a blessing. Communion with the Lord and meditating
upon his Word will elevate the soul to a plane
all radiant with Heaven's light and love, and put a
humility in your heart and a sweetness in every expression
that will distinguish you from the coarse
ways of the world. <span class="tei tei-q">“I will sing unto the Lord as
long as I live: I will sing praise to my God while I

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Close and impartial examination of our moral character
is indispensable to spiritual prosperity. He
who does not watch the inclinations of his heart,
nor note the course of its affections, and direct them
in the channels of heavenly grace, will soon have
naught but a <span class="tei tei-q">“name to live.”</span> As you read the infallible
Word of God, ask him to let its light find entrance
to the remotest chambers of your soul. Too
many read the Scriptures in a careless way. The
severity of God's judgments are turned aside by the
enemy of their soul. We fear that too many people
are to-day building hopes of heaven upon an experience
of years ago. They will talk of the time
when they found the Savior and enjoyed his love.
But now they have become formal and do not sit in
impartial judgment upon their actions. The holy
apostle said, <span class="tei tei-q">“Examine yourselves, whether ye be in
the faith; prove your own selves.”</span> 2 Cor. 13:5.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Closely examine your actions, your life, your nature,
and prove your spiritual condition by the Word
of God. Thousands to-day are deceived and on the
broad way to eternal night and woe because they
never stop to reason and to carefully examine their
lives and spiritual condition in what light and knowledge
they have of the Scriptures. How many will
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page213">[pg 213]</span><a name="Pg213" id="Pg213" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
read, <span class="tei tei-q">“Love not the world, neither the things that are
in the world; if any man love the world the love of
the Father is not in him,”</span> and pass on with a heart
filled with the love of the world, consoling themselves
that they are on their way to heaven. If they
were but serious enough to examine their hearts
they would feel the condemnation of God's Spirit as
they read such texts, but ofttimes when they are
brought to any consideration they will search for evidence
to neutralize their guilt. They will again
read, <span class="tei tei-q">“Man shall give an account of every idle word,”</span>
and go on talking foolishly and jesting, seeking to
believe they are God's own children. And thus goes
the world.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
If you value your soul and hope of heaven, see
to it that your life is in strict accordance with every
requirement of the Scriptures. People are having
idle talk, impure thoughts, evil surmising, feelings
of pride, envy and hatred. They are speaking evil
of their neighbors, laying up their treasures upon
earth, loving the world and self, rendering evil for
evil, backbiting, reveling, and professing to be traveling
the narrow way that leads to eternal rest the same
as if there was no Bible. Such have no examination
of their lives, and should they have they use some satanic
sophistry to gloss their sin. <span class="tei tei-q">“Who is a wise
man and endued with knowledge?”</span> It is he that
shows out of a godly life that he is a Christian. It
is he that carefully examines every act and thought
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page214">[pg 214]</span><a name="Pg214" id="Pg214" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
and word and by Heaven's grace tolerates nothing
in his life in opposition to the Word of God. Careful
examination is an important factor in our spiritual
prosperity. By carefully watching our life we can
detect its defects and then by earnest prayer these
defects can be removed and we grow up into the
image of God. If you hold but little or no examination
of your conduct there may be many imperfections
in your ways of life displeasing to God, and
yet unknown to you. You will find it beneficial to frequently
seclude yourself from the busy whirl of life,
and enter into profound meditation and careful examination.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
We will suggest a few general questions, which may
help you in your retrospection. Have my meditations
been pure and acceptable to God through this
day? Have I not spoken one idle word? Am I as
thankful to God for blessings as I should be? Has
there been any feeling of pride in my heart? Has
there been any feeling of impatience within me?
Have I felt and manifested any selfishness? Have
I had a due regard for the welfare and happiness of
others? Have my devotions been spiritual and full
of reverence? Do I love God? Am I dead to sin?
Do I love secret prayer and the reading of the Bible?
Do I feel as deeply as I should the sins of this lost
world? Have I spent my money for self and withheld
from God? All told, what have I done for
Jesus? These and many other questions the Christian
may ask himself to see if he is in the faith.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In the chapter of <span class="tei tei-q">“Spiritual Culture”</span> we have
included the subject of Backsliding, not that backsliding
is in any sense advantageous to spiritual development,
but it is our certain destiny if we do not
assiduously employ the means necessary to our
growth in grace. By <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">backsliding</span></em> is meant the gradual
turning back or away from God; to apostatize.
The Savior gives us warning to <span class="tei tei-q">“watch and
pray,”</span> that we <span class="tei tei-q">“enter not into temptation.”</span> The
tempter will lay in your pathway all things possible
to induce you to turn away from God. He will
suggest that it is not necessary to pray so much, and
we do not have to keep such a strict vigil over our
lives and govern and rule the whole by the Word of
God. He may tell you that now since you are saved
you are safe. God is able to keep you, and you have
nothing now to do but to silently fold your arms and
sail to heaven on <span class="tei tei-q">“flowery beds of ease.”</span> There
never was a soul created of God or recreated by his
Spirit, not excepting the Savior himself, since the
day Adam was made of the dust, to this present
time, but what Satan has endeavored, by lies and
machinations to turn him away from God. Thousands
of millions have gone down the rapids of negligence
and carelessness, and been lost in the whirlpool
of a cold, formal religion.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Some teach that the soul once born of God can
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page216">[pg 216]</span><a name="Pg216" id="Pg216" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
never apostatize. <span class="tei tei-q">“Once in grace always in grace,”</span>
is the manner in which they state it. We are fully
persuaded that the individual who teaches such a
doctrine is wholly ignorant of grace and devoid of
God's enlightening Spirit. What would be the need
of Christians being warned to <span class="tei tei-q">“watch and pray,
lest they enter into temptation,”</span> if there be no possibility
of being overcome by it? If there is
never a return to sin after regeneration, why does
John say to his little children, <span class="tei tei-q">“If any man sin, we
have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the
righteous”</span>? 1 John 2:1.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The reader will not understand us to favor the
teaching that Christians must of necessity occasionally
commit sin and that none live a sinless life. It
is impossible for man to be committing sin and at
the same time be a Christian. A sinning Christian is
a phenomenon never known in the kingdom of grace.
The Scriptures plainly teach that when once we enter
a state of grace, we should always, by living a
pure, holy life, continue in the same. But the teaching
that when we once enter a state of grace we always
remain in that state, no matter what we do,
is certainly very foreign to the Holy Scriptures and
soul deluding. God spoke by the mouth of an Old
Testament prophet nearly six hundred years before
the coming of <span class="tei tei-q">“grace and truth”</span> by the Savior,
saying, <span class="tei tei-q">“When a righteous man doth turn from his
righteousness, and commit iniquity, and I lay a
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page217">[pg 217]</span><a name="Pg217" id="Pg217" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
stumbling-block before him, he shall die: because thou
hast not given him warning, he shall die in his sin, and
his righteousness which he hath done shall not be
remembered.”</span> Ezek. 3:20. What need be, and what
can be, plainer than this text? Here iniquity and
sin are used interchangeably and are perfectly synonymous.
If a righteous man (one in possession of
grace) commits sin his righteousness is no longer
remembered. This is as much as to say he is no longer
in grace, but is fallen. In the next verse this holy
seer receives words from the mouth of the Almighty
and gives the righteous man warning that he sin
not. If he does not sin he shall live. It is sin that
brings death to the soul. Ezek. 18:4. It is sin that
separates us from God. Isa. 59:2. It is sin that
causes our names to be blotted out of the book of life.
Ex. 32:33. It is sin that withholds good things from
us. Jer. 5:25. It is sin that destroys grace. Rom.
6:1, 2.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
What is sin? Sin is the transgression of God's law.
1 John 3:4. Who in all the earth has become so
boldly defiant that he can in the face of clear and
plain Scriptural statements testify that he is in a state
of grace when he is living in known violation of
some of God's commandments? His boldness will
forsake him and he wither like the frail flower beneath
the hoary frost when he comes into the awful
majestic presence of a righteous Creator in that great
avenging day.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
One of the inspired writers of the New Testament
exhorts Christians to give all diligence that we
add virtue to our faith, and knowledge to our virtue,
and temperance to our knowledge, and to temperance
patience, and to patience godliness, and to godliness
brotherly kindness, and to brotherly kindness charity.
2 Pet. 1:5-7. In the following verses he tells us if
these things abound in us we shall be neither barren
nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord, and
if we do these things we shall never fall. Does not
this obviously imply that if we do not do them that
we shall fall? Dear reader, if you are now a Christian
and feel the glowing of God's pure love in your heart,
if you neglect to employ the means for growth in
grace that the Bible commands, that certainly you will
backslide, or fall from grace. You may retain a
form of worship, but you will be devoid of spirituality
and your worship be unacceptable. We are commanded
to <span class="tei tei-q">“grow in grace.”</span> 2 Pet. 3:18. In the
verse above we are warned against being led away by
the error of the wicked and falling from our own
steadfastness.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Now it is a well established fact in the very nature
of things that it would be impossible to grow if there
was no possibility of a decline. If there be no retrogression,
there can be no progression. The beloved
John from the lonely isle writes unto the church of
Ephesus and tells them that God had somewhat
against them because they had left their first love.
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page219">[pg 219]</span><a name="Pg219" id="Pg219" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
He tells them to remember from whence they are fallen
and repent. They once enjoyed the love of God—they
were spiritual. His redeeming grace had removed
the guilt of sin, but now they are fallen. He
that hath an ear, let him hear.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
How often the apostle Paul warns the Christian
against backsliding. His motto was, <span class="tei tei-q">“I press toward
the mark for the prize of the high calling of God in
Christ Jesus.”</span> Phil. 3:14. In writing to the Colossians
he says, <span class="tei tei-q">“Luke, the beloved physician, and
Demas,”</span> greet you. A greeting was sent from Demas
by Paul to the Colossians in the year 64, A.D. In
writing his letter to Philemon, A.D. 64, Paul says,
<span class="tei tei-q">“There salute thee Epaphras, my fellow prisoner in
Christ Jesus; Marcus, Aristarchus, Demas, Lucas, my
fellow laborers.”</span> Ver. 23, 24. Demas was one of Paul's
coworkers, and undoubtedly enjoyed the experience of
salvation by grace. In writing to Timothy two years
later Paul says, <span class="tei tei-q">“For Demas hath forsaken me, having
loved this present world.”</span> 2 Tim. 4:10.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
As on the other subjects of this volume many more
texts and strong points of reasoning could be given
to fixedly establish the New Testament teaching of
the possibilities of spiritual degeneration and death,
but we conclude that we have made all plain to the
understanding of every candid mind. It has not been
our purpose to exhaust any subject. It has not been
our expectation to convince many gainsayers, but
to bring light to the hearts which the Lord has prepared.
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page220">[pg 220]</span><a name="Pg220" id="Pg220" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
One text of Scripture used by propagators of the
doctrine, <span class="tei tei-q">“We can never fall from grace,”</span> is found
in 1 John 3:9, and reads thus: <span class="tei tei-q">“Whosoever is born of
God doth not commit sin: for his seed remaineth in
him: and he can not sin, because he is born of God.”</span>
We believe it is safe to always give the Scriptures the
plainest, simplest meaning when it does not conflict
with the Word of God elsewhere. We should never
mystify a text, but accept it as it reads. In 1 John
2:1, the author of this epistle says, <span class="tei tei-q">“My little children,
these things write I unto you, that ye sin not.
And if any man sin, we have an advocate with the
Father, Jesus Christ the righteous.”</span> Certainly
every reader understands John to here teach that it
is possible for man to sin, or in other words, no man
in this life passes beyond the possibilities of sin. Now
to understand him to say in the ninth verse of the
third chapter that when we are once born of God we
can not possibly sin, makes him to teach contradictory
doctrines. Such we know he does not do, and since
1 John 2:1 is too plain to be misunderstood, we must
look about to harmonize with it, in the most simple
way, 1 John 3:9. We will quote Rotherham on this
text: <span class="tei tei-q">“No one that hath been begotten of God doeth sin,
because his seed in him abideth, and he can not be sinning,
because of God has he been begotten.”</span> To be
begotten of God is to be pardoned or saved from sin.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The seed (the Christ-life) abides in the soul in the
regenerated state. The seeds of life are supplanted
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page221">[pg 221]</span><a name="Pg221" id="Pg221" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
by the seeds of death when we commit sin. No one is
born of God when spiritual life has been destroyed by
sin. No man can be <span class="tei tei-q">“sinning”</span> and be a child of
God. One who has been saved may be overcome
and commit sin, but when he does so he is not God's
child. This text does not teach the impossibility of
committing sin after we are born of God, but only the
impossibility of committing sin and being a Christian.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Unmistakably there exists a wide gulf of separation
between the children of God and the children of the
world. Christ is the only avenue of escape from the
world. The wide, open door of salvation is the exit.
He who would return from the blissful shores of
Christianity to the beggarly elements of the world
can do so only on the transporting barges of Satan.
As a tree is known by its fruits, so is a true follower
of Christ. The fruit borne by a Christian is directly
opposite in its nature to the fruit borne by the worldling.
It is not the profession merely that produces the
separation, but it is the manner of life. The Son
of God is the great exemplar of Christianity. Just
what true Christian principles did in him will in the
very nature of things do for all who possess like
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page222">[pg 222]</span><a name="Pg222" id="Pg222" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
principles. We are forced to the conclusion that the
professed follower of Christ is destitute of Christian
principles when he delights himself in worldliness.
Jesus said of himself, <span class="tei tei-q">“I am not of this world.”</span>
John 8:23. He says of his followers, <span class="tei tei-q">“If ye were of
the world, the world would love his own: but because
ye are not of the world, but I have chosen you out of
the world, therefore the world hateth you.”</span> John
15:19.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Paul bears testimony to his separation from the
world by the grace of God. In Eph. 2:2, 3 he speaks
of the time when he lived among those who were
worldly. He says, <span class="tei tei-q">“Wherein [in sin] in time past ye
walked according to the course of this world, according
to the prince of the power of the air, the spirit
that now worketh in the children of disobedience:
among whom also we all had our conversation in times
past in the lusts of our flesh, fulfilling the desires of the
flesh and of the mind: and were by nature the children
of wrath, even as others.”</span> In the next two
verses he testifies to the effects of saving grace: <span class="tei tei-q">“But
God, who is rich in mercy, for his great love wherewith
he loved us, even when we were dead in sins, hath
quickened us together with Christ; by grace ye are
saved.”</span> It must be made obvious to all by these
texts that salvation from sin by grace saves from
walking according to the course of the world.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Again the apostle gives testimony: <span class="tei tei-q">“But God forbid
that I should glory, save in the cross of our
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page223">[pg 223]</span><a name="Pg223" id="Pg223" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Lord Jesus Christ, by whom the world is crucified
unto me, and I unto the world.”</span> Gal. 6:14. How
true! When man accepts Christ he is by him separated
from the world. Jesus was not of the world.
He was the light of the world. The world was in
darkness. Light is the opposite of darkness. Had he
been of the world and like the world he would not
have been a light. Christians are said to be <span class="tei tei-q">“the
light of the world,”</span> and are to shine as lights in
the world. They are lights in the world because
of the righteous principles they possess and manifest.
They are like Jesus and in as direct contrast to the
world as he. The Savior says, <span class="tei tei-q">“I have given them
thy word; and the world hath hated them, because
they are not of the world, even as I am not of the
world. I pray not that thou shouldest take them
out of the world, but that thou shouldest keep them
from the evil. They are not of the world even as I am
not of the world.”</span> John 17:14-16.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It is impossible for the heart's affections to be centered
upon opposing natures. For instance, it is
impossible for man to admire honesty and dishonesty;
to love temperance and intemperance; to enjoy peace
and strife. It is equally impossible for man to both
love and possess sin and righteousness. <span class="tei tei-q">“No man
can serve two masters: for either he will hate the
one, and love the other; or else he will hold to the
one, and despise the other. Ye can not serve God
and mammon.”</span> Mat. 6:24. It is impossible to love
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page224">[pg 224]</span><a name="Pg224" id="Pg224" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
God and the world: <span class="tei tei-q">“Love not the world, neither the
things that are in the world. If any man love the
world, the love of the Father is not in him. For all
that is in the world, the lust of the flesh, and the
lust of the eyes, and the pride of life, is not of the
Father, but is of the world. And the world passeth
away, and the lust thereof: but he that doeth the
will of God abideth forever.”</span> 1 John 2:15-17. <span class="tei tei-q">“For
do I now persuade men, or God? or do I seek to please
men? for if I yet pleased men, I should not be the
servant of Christ.”</span> Gal. 1:10. <span class="tei tei-q">“Ye adulterers and
adulteresses, know ye not that the friendship of the
world is enmity with God? whosoever therefore will
be a friend of the world is the enemy of God.”</span> Jas.
4:4.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
These are plain declarative texts. It is not meant
by them that Christians do not love sinners and can
not be friends to them. Christ loved and died for
sinners. He visited them in their homes while here on
earth, but never did he approve of their sinful ways.
He never participated with them in anything that was
worldly. He was not influenced by the world into any
spirit of worldly merriment. He loved the souls of
men, but he did not love the world. He was holy,
harmless, undefiled, and separate from sinners.
Heb. 7:26. Christians, like Christ, love mankind,
and are friendly and treat with respect and kindness
the sinner, but never participate with him, nor become
influenced in sinful, worldly ways. The affections
of the Christian are set on things above. Col. 3:1.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In the early ministry of the Savior there is an intimation
that the righteous shall be persecuted. It is
found in these words: <span class="tei tei-q">“Blessed are they which are
persecuted for righteousness' sake: for theirs is the
kingdom of heaven. Blessed are ye, when men shall
revile you, and persecute you, and shall say all manner
of evil against you falsely, for my sake.”</span> Mat. 5:10, 11.
From whence may the righteous expect these
persecutions? We learned in the preceding subject
that Christians were not of the world. We learn
also by the Scriptures that they are hated by the
world. Jesus was hated by the world because of the
light of Christian virtue and righteousness that shone
through him. Those that glorify God by reflecting
the righteousness of Christ to the world will be regarded
with the same feeling. <span class="tei tei-q">“If the world hate
you, ye know that it hated me before it hated you.”</span>
John 15:18. In every age of the world, from the
days of Cain and Abel to the present, true Christians
have been hated and persecuted by the wicked, and
especially by false worshipers.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
We will farther quote the language of the Savior:
<span class="tei tei-q">“If ye were of the world, the world would love his
own: but because ye are not of the world, but I have
chosen you out of the world, therefore the world hateth
you. Remember the word I said unto you, The
servant is not greater than his Lord. If they have
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page226">[pg 226]</span><a name="Pg226" id="Pg226" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
persecuted me, they will also persecute you; if they
have kept my saying, they will keep yours also.
But all these things will they do unto you for my
name's sake, because they know not him that sent
me.”</span> John 15:19-21. When pretended worshipers
of God are free from persecutions for Christ's sake
it is because they are worshipers in form only, but
in spirit they are worldly. In truth these people are
usually foremost in persecuting the true children of
God. Jesus was persecuted and hated by the very pretentious
Pharisees and Sadducees. <span class="tei tei-q">“He came unto his
own, and his own received him not.”</span> John 1:11.
Those who professed to be children of Abraham
sought to take the Savior's life. John 8:39, 40.
Because Jesus by a pure, holy life rebuked sin, because
he in burning words of Heaven's glorious truth
exposed the hypocrisy of the proud Jews, because
he told them of their sins, they gnashed upon him
with their teeth; they told him he had a devil; they
spit upon him; they smote him; they mocked him;
they placed a crown of thorns upon his brow, and
were the instigators of his death.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Jesus says to his own beloved followers: <span class="tei tei-q">“If they
have persecuted me, they will also persecute you.”</span>
John 15:20. <span class="tei tei-q">“If they have called the master of the
house Beelzebub, how much more shall they call
them of his household?”</span> Mat. 10:25. <span class="tei tei-q">“And ye shall
be hated of all men for my name's sake.”</span> Luke 21:17.
Those who live like Jesus, those who will boldly

Christians must suffer the taunts of a sinful world,
but they <span class="tei tei-q">“rejoice, inasmuch as ye are partakers of
Christ's sufferings; that, when his glory shall be
revealed, ye may be glad also with exceeding joy.
If ye be reproached for the name of Christ, happy are
ye; for the Spirit of glory and of God resteth upon
you.”</span> 1 Pet. 4:13, 14. <span class="tei tei-q">“Blessed are ye when men
shall hate you, and when they shall separate you
from their company, and shall reproach you, and
cast out your name as evil, for the Son of man's sake.
Rejoice ye in that day, and leap for joy: for, behold,
your reward is great in heaven: for in the like manner
did their fathers unto the prophets.”</span> Luke 6:22, 23.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
One evening, shortly after God by his saving grace
had separated us from the world and bestowed his
righteousness upon us, we for Christ's sake received
insults and abuse from the wicked. We turned away
from our persecutors and entered the privacy of our
home, when a rich glory rested in such a heavenly
sweetness upon our souls that we cried out, <span class="tei tei-q">“O God,
why am I so wonderfully blessed?”</span> The answer came:
<span class="tei tei-q">“If ye be reproached for the name of Christ, happy
are ye; for the Spirit of glory and of God resteth
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page228">[pg 228]</span><a name="Pg228" id="Pg228" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
upon you.”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“Rejoice ye in that day and leap for
joy.”</span> The grace and glory that was poured out upon
our soul on this occasion would have made the coals
and flames of martyrdom a bed of sweet repose.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Stephen as he faced death at the hands of cruel
persecutors, saw the glory of God and the heavens
opened and saw the Son of man for whose sake he
was now stoned. Paul and Silas with their feet
made fast in the stocks at midnight prayed and sang
praises to God. Is it not an occasion of wonder and
astonishment how the bigoted zeal of deceived and
blinded, high-minded professors leads them to become
the most vile persecutors of the righteous? Paul persecuted
the church of God and wasted it. He
thought he was doing God's service. The children
of God in every age have received their persecutions
from religious bigots, and so will it ever be. We
rejoice to be counted worthy to suffer for Jesus' sake.
We glory in the midst of tribulations. The Spirit of
God and of glory rests upon the devoted Christian
in affliction's furnace, and a bright, blessed hope of
great eternal reward ever cheers and nerves his
faltering soul. He, who, in this dark world will
suffer with the Savior shall share a blissful eternity
with him.

The affections of a Christian's heart are set on
things above, and not on things on the earth. Col.
3:2. The entertainments, such as suppers, festivals,
parties, concerts, regardless of what may be the
ultimate object, are engaged in and enjoyed only by
the worldly minded and graceless hearted. <span class="tei tei-q">“She
that liveth in pleasure is dead while she liveth.”</span>
1 Tim. 5:6. Those who find enjoyment in the
amusements afforded by the world are without spiritual
life. <span class="tei tei-q">“Go to now, ye rich men, weep and howl
for your miseries that shall come upon you....
Ye have lived in pleasure on the earth, and been wanton.”</span>
Jas. 5:1, 5. A life of pleasure here on the
earth in wantonness is directly opposed to a life
with Christ. <span class="tei tei-q">“No man can serve two masters.”</span>
People who participate in and enjoy the socials, the
suppers, the fairs, and picnics, the Christmas festivities
and church entertainments of the present time
have but little or no comprehension of true Christianity.
They are ignorant of God's true character
and the power and beauty of his holiness. Children
of God are to live <span class="tei tei-q">“soberly, righteously, and godly
in this present world.”</span> Titus 2:12.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Revelry is one of the fruits of the flesh, which
if borne in our life, or, in other words, if we engage
in, Paul tells us we shall never inherit the kingdom
of God. Gal. 5:21. Peter tells us that the time of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page230">[pg 230]</span><a name="Pg230" id="Pg230" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
his life when he walked in sin, when he indulged
in the lusts of the flesh was sufficient to have wrought
the will of the Gentiles, to walk in lusts and engage
in revelings and banquetings. Salvation saved him
from such a life, and his former worldly associates
think it strange that he will not engage with them
in the worldly riotousness and pleasures any longer,
and because he is saved from such a course they
speak evil of him. This is the substance of 1 Pet.
4:1-4. The gay scenes of a worldly life with their
pleasures and mirth have no delight for the heart
filled with Christian love. He who loves God has no
love for worldly sports. The pleasurable society of
Jesus destroys all taste for the society of the world.
The Christian's walk is alone with God.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
An individual saved by grace will experience a
marked change in his language. The apostle says
that in the time of his life when he walked according
to the world he had his conversation in the lusts of the
flesh. Eph. 2:2, 3. It is true the word <span class="tei tei-q">“conversation”</span>
in this text, and many others, is by many translators
rendered <span class="tei tei-q">“conduct,”</span> which is a more correct translation.
But this is made to include the words of speech.
<span class="tei tei-q">“Out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh.”</span>
Mat. 12:34. Where worldliness and foolishness
is lodged in the heart it will be manifest in the
conversation. Gay, frivolous, foolish talk, mirthful
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page231">[pg 231]</span><a name="Pg231" id="Pg231" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
stories, and language in jest, indicate a graceless heart.
Listen at the world in conversation. Note the idle
bywords, the slang phrases, the jestings, the gay,
giddy, foolish expressions, the low and impure speech,
which is all foreign to the kingdom of grace. Man is
not to be known by his profession, but by his fruits:
<span class="tei tei-q">“Wherefore by their fruits ye shall know them.”</span>
Mat. 7:20. Thus we know regardless of profession,
when man's conversation is as the above, that he is
destitute of God's pure love and grace.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Be ye holy in all manner of conversation,”</span> is the
command of God's holy Word as recorded in 1 Pet.
1:15. From a pure heart can only flow a pure and
holy speech. <span class="tei tei-q">“Let no corrupt communication proceed
out of your mouth, but that which is good to the
use of edifying, that it may minister grace unto the
hearers.”</span> Eph. 4:29. Our words are to be in such
gravity and sincerity, in such depth of wisdom, and
so flavored with the seasoning qualities of grace as
to be elevating or inspiring to a higher degree of
piety the listener. <span class="tei tei-q">“Let your speech be alway with
grace, seasoned with salt, that ye may know how ye
ought to answer every man.”</span> Col. 4:6. God's saving
grace effects a change in the heart, and as a natural
result a change in the conversation. Paul no longer
walked according to the course of this world in conversation
when saved by the grace of God.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Where there are amusing stories told, idle expressions,
unmeaning remarks, jestings and jokings,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page232">[pg 232]</span><a name="Pg232" id="Pg232" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
regardless of the assumed sanctity in the hour of public
worship, it is a life after the manner of the world,
and betrays a heart devoid of God's sober, solemn,
holy presence, and the sanctimonious appearance on
sacred occasions is but an effort of the human will,
and not the deep piety and spontaneous reverence of
the heart. Jesus said that for every idle word that
men shall speak they shall give an account thereof in
the day of judgment: <span class="tei tei-q">“For by thy words thou shalt
be justified, and by thy words thou shalt be condemned.”</span>
Mat. 12:36, 37. <span class="tei tei-q">“Young men likewise exhort
to be sober-minded. In all things, showing thyself a
pattern of good works: in doctrine showing uncorruptness,
gravity, sincerity, sound speech, that can
not be condemned.”</span> Titus 2:6-8. <span class="tei tei-q">“But fornication,
and all uncleanness, or covetousness, let it not be once
named among you, as becometh saints; neither filthiness,
nor foolish talking, nor jesting, which are not
convenient.”</span> Eph. 5:3, 4. Slang phrases, gay, frivolous,
foolish talking, and unholy conversation is degrading
to society, disgraceful to Christianity, and a
shame and a reproach to any people.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
When the new birth is experienced a marked change
is made in the life. The individual is made a new
creature, old things are passed away and all things
become new. The heart that loved this world is gone,
and a heart filled with the love of God and heaven
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page233">[pg 233]</span><a name="Pg233" id="Pg233" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
takes its place. The radical change effected within
the heart will affect the exterior man. <span class="tei tei-q">“Make clean
the inside of the cup and platter and the outside will
be clean also.”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“Out of the heart are the issues of
life.”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“Out of the abundance of the heart the mouth
speaketh.”</span> It is impossible for a proud heart to receive
the grace of God. <span class="tei tei-q">“God resisteth the proud,
and giveth grace to the humble.”</span> 1 Pet. 5:5. The
wonderful salvation of God which changes the heart
will also change the manner of dress, if the dress
formerly was worldly, which is very natural. The
dear Lord has been so very careful to distinguish his
loved children from the world and make them a shining
light that he has given them plain directions how
to dress. What a privilege the Christian has in obeying
God in what is considered the <span class="tei tei-q">“little things”</span> of
his Word, which however small are of such importance
as to cause the eternal loss of the soul if wilfully
disobeyed.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Respecting the manner of Christian dress we will
quote from 1 Tim. 2:9, 10: <span class="tei tei-q">“In like manner also, that
women adorn themselves in modest apparel, with
shamefacedness and sobriety; not with braided hair,
or gold, or pearls, or costly array; but (which becometh
women professing godliness) with good works.”</span> This
is a much abused and wrested scripture. The proud-hearted,
who have endeavored to persuade themselves
to believe they are Christians, have surmised and
planned to enforce upon themselves the conclusion that
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page234">[pg 234]</span><a name="Pg234" id="Pg234" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
God did not here mean what he has said. In earlier
days when the human systems of religion were more
consistent with the Word of God such texts were incorporated
in their creeds, but so deep has been their
plunge into the whirlpool of worldliness that they
are rejected from both Bible and creed. Many tell
us that this was for the women in the primitive days
of Christianity when it was the custom to plait the
hair with gold and silver strands. This is only a
ready sophistry to allure the soul. We will admit
it was for women in the early days of Christianity,
but we deny it is any less for women and men also in
any other day. With respect to Christianity some
people are shamefully dishonest. All the duties and
sacrifices not congenial to a proud heart they are glad
to impose upon the Christians of some past or future
time, but all the blessings God has promised the saint
they would gladly receive in this present time.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The Christian is commanded to dress in <span class="tei tei-q">“modest
apparel”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“with shamefacedness.”</span> It frequently happens
that people become so boldly proud that they
can dress in the height of fashion and profess to be
Christians without a shame upon their face. One who
is really and truly saved will dress in modest apparel,
while humility, meekness, and modesty are depicted
in loveliness upon their countenance. Those who
adorn themselves in pearls and gold and costly array
usually bear a proud, disdainful look. When redeemed
by grace the fashionable dress and proud look give
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page235">[pg 235]</span><a name="Pg235" id="Pg235" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
place to a sweet Christian modesty. A humble heart
and a fashionable dress are incompatible. Shamefacedness
is derived from <span lang="el" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="el"><span style="font-style: italic">aidos</span></span> in the Greek, and
has <span class="tei tei-q">“modesty”</span> and <span class="tei tei-q">“bashfulness”</span> for its primary
meaning.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
How beautifully the teachings of the apostles harmonize.
Peter tells us that the Christian's adorning
should be the hidden man of the heart adorned by a
meek and quiet spirit. This man in the heart, hidden
as he is, does however reveal himself. <span class="tei tei-q">“Out of the
heart are the issues of life.”</span> When the heart is meek
and humble, lowliness, gentleness, and modesty will
be seen in the countenance. A meek, modest, Christ-like
countenance under a fashionably decorated hat
is the greatest incongruity. With shamefacedness the
Christian is to be adorned with sobriety.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Fashionable dress is directly the opposite of sobriety.
This word is translated from the Greek word
<span lang="el" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="el"><span style="font-style: italic">sophrou</span></span>, which is properly defined, soundness
of mind. The weary toil and labor that many undergo
to earn money and then make the unnecessary expenditure
in buying costly, fashionable dress does
certainly betray a lack of wisdom, which might in reality
be termed an unsoundness of mind. Gold and
pearls and costly array is intemperance in dress. Instead
of dressing in sobriety many are crazed or
drunken on the spirit of worldliness in dress. There
is a beautiful consistency in Christianity, but how inconsistent
with divine things is the expenditure of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page236">[pg 236]</span><a name="Pg236" id="Pg236" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
money for the adornment of the physical being. No
one can spend money for gold rings and chains and
charms, for pearls and beads, for plumed hats, and
such like, with the number around that are destitute,
penniless, and starving, without incurring the displeasure
of a merciful God. Man shall have to give
an account in the day of awful judgment how he has
expended the money the Lord has entrusted to his
care. In the purchasing of any unnecessary article
of dress there will be a reproving of the Spirit
unless the heart is so intoxicated with the love of self
that it is unconscious of the things and voice of God.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Ah, how shamefully inconsistent with the tender-heartedness
and sympathizing spirit of Christianity
in this lavishing of charms and adornments upon self!
Our dress should be only such as is necessary
for protection and health. Going about in the world
doing good in all humility of heart, modest and unassuming
in our manners and dress, making ourselves
as little conspicuous as possible, but lifting up Jesus
everywhere, is the true Christian life.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The present-day institutions known as <span class="tei tei-q">“Secret
Orders,”</span> are of an earthly, worldly origin. They are
one of the things of this world which man can not
love and continue in the love of God. Within those
secret organizations are bundled together by strong
oaths the professed Christian, the infidel, the lawyer,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page237">[pg 237]</span><a name="Pg237" id="Pg237" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the doctor, the saloon-keeper, the gambler, and almost
every character upon the earth. By the bonds of this
secret union the preacher is made a brother with an
infidel. The apostle Paul tells us, <span class="tei tei-q">“Be ye not unequally
yoked together with unbelievers: for what fellowship
hath righteousness with unrighteousness? and
what communion hath light with darkness? and
what concord hath Christ with Belial? or what part
hath he that believeth with an infidel?”</span> 2 Cor. 6:14,
15.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The preacher who professes to believe in God is
here having a part with an infidel contrary to the
Word of God. You who are professing to be a light
in the world, how can you in the fear of God take
the oaths necessary to make you a member of a secret
order? How can you join in the worldly hurrah and
laughter, and foolish, ungodly pranks as played upon
the candidate within the secret walls? What do you
think of a preacher, or layman, becoming the laughing-stock
of infidels, lawyers, saloon-keepers, drunkards,
and gamblers, as he trembles beneath the blindfold?
What kind of light are they letting shine? I appeal to
your reason and common sense. Is it Christlike? Do
you think Jesus would engage in such dark works?
Some have charged the Savior with being a freemason.
Such is a libelous statement. In Isa. 45:19, the Lord
says, <span class="tei tei-q">“I have not spoken in secret, in a dark place of
the earth: ... I the Lord speak righteousness, I
declare things that are right.”</span> Christ only speaks
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page238">[pg 238]</span><a name="Pg238" id="Pg238" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the things that are right and never the dark, ungodly
oaths and sayings of the secret lodge. Again,
the Savior said, <span class="tei tei-q">“I spake openly to the world; I ever
taught in the synagogue, and in the temple, whither
the Jews always resort: and in secret have I said
nothing.”</span> John 18:20. Jesus spake nothing in secret,
and to charge him with having connection with the
dark, secret mysteries of masonry is as slanderous as
the charge made by the people who said, <span class="tei tei-q">“Thou hast a
devil.”</span> John 7:20. The Savior not only knew that
men would, in order to defend their unrighteous
systems, charge him with having a devil, but he also
knew that for the same purpose men would charge
him with having connections with such systems; therefore
he said, to uncloak the falsity of such charges,
<span class="tei tei-q">“Wherefore if they shall say unto you, Behold, he
is in the desert; go not forth: behold, he is in the
secret chambers; believe it not.”</span> Mat. 24:26. Jesus
gives commandment to preach upon the housetop
what ye hear in the ear. Mat. 10:27. <span class="tei tei-q">“For God shall
bring every work into judgment, with every secret
thing, whether it be good, or whether it be evil.”</span>
Eccl. 12:14.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It is not the mission of this work to reveal the
awful oaths and secret works of these various orders.
Other men by many volumes have done this. We
only hope to help you to see that secrecy is contrary
to the Bible and the Spirit of Christ and Christianity.
It is a thing of the world and conducted on a worldly
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page239">[pg 239]</span><a name="Pg239" id="Pg239" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
basis. Connected with many of these orders are life
insurances—a thing of the world. The Christian is
separated from the world and Christ becomes his all
in all. To make prominent the good qualities of their
secret systems men tell us of their obligations to help
their brother and his family. How these orders provide
help for a man in time of need, and how true
each member is to his obligation, etc. Such might
do if there were no God nor Christianity. Secrecy provides
only for its own members. Salvation provides
for all. A member of a secret order is under no obligation
from his order to visit a poor sick man by the
way who is not a member of his order, but is under
obligation to visit and care for a sick fellow member,
though he be rich. We see no Christianity in this.
We see no humanity. It is having respect of persons,
forbidden by Scripture. Humanity, and much more
Christianity, will not only send man to do good to the
rich, but to the poor also, be they of any class or nation.
A man that is a Christian will visit the sick
and afflicted, no matter what may be their station in
life.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
If a man thinks he is a light in the world because
he is true to the obligations of his secret order in
visiting and administering to the needs of his sick
brother, he is very much deceived. Such is a false
light. When a man has to place himself under such
solemn oaths to do good, it proves that he has but
little or no humanity. <span class="tei tei-q">“Do good to all men,”</span> is the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page240">[pg 240]</span><a name="Pg240" id="Pg240" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
spirit of Christianity. A man need not take the obligations
of a secret order to be furnished with the qualifications
for doing good. The Word of God is all that
is needed for reproof, correction, and instruction, that
a man may be thoroughly furnished unto all good
works. 2 Tim. 3:16, 17. A man need not seek membership
in some secret organization in order to be provided
for in his old days, or his family in case of his
death. The Psalmist says, <span class="tei tei-q">“I have been young, and
now am old; yet have I not seen the righteous forsaken,
nor his seed begging bread.”</span> Paul says, <span class="tei tei-q">“But
my God shall supply all your need.”</span> Phil. 4:19.
<span class="tei tei-q">“Wherefore come out from among them, and be ye
separate, saith the Lord, and touch not the unclean
thing; and I will receive you, and will be a Father unto
you, and ye shall be my sons and daughters, saith
the Lord Almighty.”</span> 2 Cor. 6:17, 18. <span class="tei tei-q">“They are not
of the world, even as I am not of the world.”</span> John
17:16.

The public worship of Christians is an inspiring

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The union of man and woman in marriage is the
work of the Creator. God saw after he had created
man that it was not good for him to be alone. Such
was his constitution. So he made a helpmeet for
him. God from the rib of man made woman and
brought her unto him, who said, <span class="tei tei-q">“This is now bone
of my bones, and flesh of my flesh: she shall be called
Woman, because she was taken out of Man. Therefore
shall a man leave his father and his mother, and
shall cleave unto his wife: and they shall be one
flesh.”</span> Gen. 2:22-24.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In conjunction with the divine institution of marriage
there is also a legal institution. While the civil
contract is acceptable unto God by way of preventing
promiscuous sexual intercourse, it is powerless to
make both one flesh and bone. It is only the power of
God that can make two hearts to beat as one. By the
power of his grace he makes Christians of <span class="tei tei-q">“one heart
and one soul,”</span> and of man and woman he makes
<span class="tei tei-q">“one flesh and bone.”</span> The apostle to illustrate the
blessed union of Christ and the church makes use
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page242">[pg 242]</span><a name="Pg242" id="Pg242" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of the union of man and wife. <span class="tei tei-q">“They two shall be
one flesh.”</span> Eph. 5:31. <span class="tei tei-q">“Man shall leave his father
and mother and shall be joined unto his wife.”</span>
The union between husband and wife is stronger
than between parent and child. The all-wise God
has a design in all his works. He reveals to man
in his Word his purpose in the union of man and
wife. One object in the marriage union, as we have
before said, is to prevent promiscuous sexual commerce.
<span class="tei tei-q">“Nevertheless to avoid fornication, let every
man have his own wife, and let every woman have her
own husband.”</span> 1 Cor. 7:2. The union of man and
woman is a holy and sacred institution, however
the union of Christ and the church is still a higher
and more important work of God. Therefore Paul
advises all who can live a pure life in an unmarried
state they can be more useful to God, for he careth
for the things that belong to the Lord, how he may
please the Lord. But he that is married careth for
the things that are of the world, how he may please
his wife.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Another object in the divine mind for uniting
male and female is for the purpose of procreation.
<span class="tei tei-q">“And God blessed them, and God said unto them,
Be fruitful, and multiply and replenish the earth.”</span>
Gen. 1:28. Alas! how few properly reverence and
esteem the divine purpose. Marriages are too often
contracted for the comforts of a home, or for affluence,
or for elevation in society, or, worst of all, for
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page243">[pg 243]</span><a name="Pg243" id="Pg243" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the gratification of lustful desires. Of such too
many murderously resort to the devices of art to
thwart the designs of the Creator. Procreation was
the highest purpose in the divine mind for the union
of man and wife. For this purpose he implanted
in their natures a sexual desire. They who avoid
to act this part in life come short of the purpose of
their creation.

Because the contracting parties at the marriage
shrine do not feel and have not properly considered
the obligations and responsibilities of a married life,
but enter in from selfish desires, then finding it attended
with cares and responsibilities they do not
care to bear, they seek opportunities for release. The
legal union is often severed by the same authority
as was given. But as the civil power can not create
two hearts into one, nor make of twain <span class="tei tei-q">“one flesh

of what has been made one. The law of Heaven is,
What God hath joined together, let not man put

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The Word of God fixes death as the limit to the
bond of union. <span class="tei tei-q">“For the woman which hath a husband
is bound by the law to her husband so long as
he liveth: but if the husband be dead, she is loosed
from the law of her husband. So then if while her
husband liveth, she be married to another man, she
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page244">[pg 244]</span><a name="Pg244" id="Pg244" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
shall be called an adulteress: but if her husband be
dead, she is free from that law; so that she is no
adulteress, though she be married to another man.”</span>
Rom. 7:2, 3. <span class="tei tei-q">“The wife is bound by the law as long
as her husband liveth: but if her husband be dead,
she is at liberty to be married to whom she will; only
in the Lord.”</span> 1 Cor. 7:39. <span class="tei tei-q">“And he [Jesus] saith
unto them, Whosoever shall put away his wife, and
marry another, committeth adultery against her.
And if a woman shall put away her husband, and
be married to another, she committeth adultery.”</span>
Mark 10:11, 12. In Mat. 19:9, we read, <span class="tei tei-q">“And I say
unto you, whosoever shall put away his wife, except
it be for fornication, and shall marry another, committeth
adultery: and whoso marrieth her which is
put away doth commit adultery.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Some have thought there was a lack of harmony
in the teaching of Jesus as recorded by Mark and
Matthew. Mark makes the plain statement that whosoever
puts away his wife and marries another commits
adultery. He makes no exceptions. Matthew
says, <span class="tei tei-q">“Except it be for fornication.”</span> There is no
disagreement here. It is the prominent thought each
has that makes the difference in the statements. The
truth that Mark wishes to teach is that there is no
just cause for a man marrying who has a divorced
wife. The plain statement is if a man puts away his
wife and marries another he commits adultery.
There is no exception. There is no just cause for
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page245">[pg 245]</span><a name="Pg245" id="Pg245" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
his marrying, and if he does it is adultery, no matter
what may be the cause of divorcement. The truth
that Matthew teaches is that there is one just cause
for putting away the wife. This is a just cause for
putting her away, but not for marrying again. Every
one that divorces his wife, even though it be
for fornication, and marries another violates Mark
10:11 and Luke 16:18. A man may put away his
wife for fornication, and not transgress a single text
in the Bible. Fornication is the only just cause for
man to put away his wife, or the wife the husband.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Some have fallen into the dangerous error of putting
away the wife because the Scriptures say, <span class="tei tei-q">“Be
ye not unequally yoked together with unbelievers.”</span>
2 Cor. 6:14. This is a wrong application of this text.
No doubt but it does forbid the unmarried Christian
yoking up with an unbeliever, as in 1 Cor. 7:39 the
woman whose husband is dead is at liberty to marry
whom she will; only in the Lord. However, it does
not teach the breaking of the marriage yoke. Matthew
gives the only cause. Paul says, <span class="tei tei-q">“If any brother
hath a wife that believeth not, and she be pleased
to dwell with him, let him not put her away. And
the woman which hath a husband that believeth not,
and if he be pleased to dwell with her, let her not
leave him.”</span> 1 Cor. 7:12, 13.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
A man once told us that God showed him to leave
his wife. (She was a true wife.) He was decidedly
mistaken and should have tried the spirit. <span class="tei tei-q">“What
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page246">[pg 246]</span><a name="Pg246" id="Pg246" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
therefore God hath joined together, let not man put
asunder.”</span> The word joined is from the Greek
<span lang="el" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="el"><span style="font-style: italic">suzeugnuo</span></span>. and means <span class="tei tei-q">“yoked together.”</span>
This yoke man can not break. When God by his saving grace
unites a soul with Christ, no man can break the bond
of union. Sin, and sin only, will sever the tie that
binds them together. When God unites husband
and wife into one flesh and bone, no civil court can
break the bond. When woman has become so untrue
to her husband and false to her marriage vow as to
have sexual connection with another man, God allows
such an unchaste sin, and such a sin only, to dissolve
the union. Why is fornication the only just cause
for disuniting husband and wife? Why is sin the
only cause of separation between Christ and the
Christian? It is because the design of God in sending
his Son to the world was to destroy and prevent
sin. Then of necessity when his purpose fails there
can be no union. The design of the Almighty in instituting
marriage was to secure a legitimate population
of the world, or to prevent the lewd, indiscriminate
sexual intercourse. When this purpose fails
the object of marriage fails, and there can be no
union.

Great are the responsibilities resting upon the husband.
The wife is termed the <span class="tei tei-q">“weaker vessel,”</span> unto
whom the husband is to give honor and to dwell with
according to knowledge. 1 Pet. 3:7. The Word of
God gives instruction how the husband should dwell
with the wife. It is his duty to glean knowledge
from the same and dwell with her accordingly. He
is her example. She looks unto him as her instructor,
both in precept and example. She is to be honored
by receiving the benefits, by way of counsel, support
and protection, of his superior strength. He
in his strong, courageous construction, and she in
her feminine frailty, are both heirs together of the
grace of life. When each understand their true position
and dwell together according to knowledge
their prayers rise unhindered to the throne of grace.

The Scriptures grant man authority over the wife:
<span class="tei tei-q">“But I would have you know, that the head of every
man is Christ; and the head of the woman is the man;
and the head of Christ is God.”</span> 1 Cor. 11:3. <span class="tei tei-q">“For
the husband is the head of the wife, even as Christ
is the head of the church.”</span> Eph. 5:23. You understand
the protection and care Christ has for his bride—the
church: in like manner man is responsible for
the protection and care of the wife. He takes the
position of head of the wife as Christ takes the position
of head of the church—in love. <span class="tei tei-q">“Husbands,
love your wives, even as Christ also loved the church,
and gave himself for it.”</span> Eph. 5:25. <span class="tei tei-q">“Husbands,
love your wives, and be not bitter against them.”</span>
Col. 3:19. The love of the husband must be as deep
and true for the wife as the love of Christ for the
church. He gave himself for it. Man considers not
his life for the care and protection of his wife when
he loves her. Where there is bitterness there is wanting
true love. Bitterness drives love and heaven
away from the home. <span class="tei tei-q">“Let all bitterness, and wrath,
and anger, and clamor, and evil speaking, be put
away from you, with all malice: and be ye kind one
to another, tender-hearted.”</span> Eph. 4:31, 32.

Man should take the wife into his confidence and
entrust her with the secrets of his private life. He
should respect and regard her counsel. Jacob has
given us an example. Gen. 31. Elkanah has set us
an example of comforting the wife. 1 Sam. 1:8. It

is a comparatively easy thing, unless you are abounding
in the love of God, to become neglectful of the
comfort, welfare and happiness of the wife. She in
her tender, sympathetic nature seeks for attention
and delights in being loved. Do not therefore be
sparing in your attention toward her. The fond,
affectionate wife will meet the duties, trials, afflictions
and responsibilities of life without a murmur
does she but know that she is loved. Enter into her
joys and sorrows with a regard. <span class="tei tei-q">“Let thy fountain
be blessed: and rejoice with the wife of thy youth....
Be thou ravished always with her love.”</span> Prov. 5:18, 19.
Malachi exhorts the husband to faithfulness.
<span class="tei tei-q">“Yet ye say, Wherefore? Because the Lord hath
been witness between thee and the wife of thy youth,
against whom thou hast dealt treacherously: yet is
she thy companion, and the wife of thy covenant.”</span>
Chap. 2:14. Such are some of the duties of a husband,
and he who has cast aside regard for such duties,
is a stranger to the covenant of grace.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It is a just cause of lament that so comparatively
few wives have a perfect knowledge of their rightful
position in the domestic circle. We will briefly
give a few texts from the Holy Book showing the wife
her true place in the family and her duty toward
her husband, trusting God to give her a desire to be
all that a wife should be. The fundamental principle
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page250">[pg 250]</span><a name="Pg250" id="Pg250" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
is love. Without sincere, conjugal love she can
scarcely fill the mission of wife. When woman becomes
a wife she takes a position fraught with the
greatest responsibilities. Oh, how many idle dreamers
take such positions with little feeling, thought or
comprehension of its responsibilities, and pass through
life away below the true mission of a wife. The instruction
of the inspired apostle is that the young
women be sober, love their husbands, love their
children, be discreet, chaste, keepers at home, good,
obedient to their own husbands, that the word of God
be not blasphemed. Titus 2:4, 5.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Such are the demands of the young wife made by
the Word of God. The demand made of the aged
wives is that they set a proper example in all these
things. When they do not fill these demands the
Word of God is blasphemed. When wives professing
to be Christians and a light in the world are neglectful
of home, of husband and children, they bring
Christianity into disrepute. Wives are commanded
to be sober. Instead of sobriety how often we see
them gay, silly, foolish and worldly-minded. Their
thoughts are trashy, and their conversation the same;
talking about one another, busybodies, no depth of
thought or feeling of their mission in life, but are
concerned more about the fashions and society than
the duties of home. Such characters disgrace the
cause of Christ. True love will manifest itself, and
where the wife loves the husband, home is her dearest
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page251">[pg 251]</span><a name="Pg251" id="Pg251" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
place. Her great life work is to make home happy and
attractive. She has a deep regard for the comforts
of her lord, and love lightens all her labor for him.
The true wife loves her children, which will also
find its manifestation.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Among the coarse and vulgar we have heard mothers
in provocation speak thus to their children:
<span class="tei tei-q">“Haven't you any sense?”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“You are the foolishest
thing I ever saw.”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“I'll box your head off.”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“I'll
beat you to death.”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“I wish you were dead,”</span> and
other like expressions. Such is awful language, but
it has escaped the lips of many a mother. Before the
public they like to appear gentle, mild and sweet
tempered, while in the privacy of their homes they are
snarly, snappish and cross. When it pleases God to
remove one of their little ones to a more peaceful
home above they mourn most bitterly; more because
of remorse of conscience than from a fountain of
pure love. There is, however, many a mother who
longs to be tender and kind to her loved ones, but
because of her bondage to the tyrannical power of
an ill, impatient temper, she utters, under provocation,
unfeeling, inhuman speech toward her little ones.
In her calmer hours she weeps because of bondage.
To all such we would say, There is help for you in
God. Jesus can set you free. Yield yourself to him.
He will pardon your sins and sweeten your life by his
grace. To be discreet, wise, prudent, selecting the
best means to accomplish a noble purpose is the wife's
mission in her home.

me away in the spirit to a great and high mountain,
and showed me that great city, the holy Jerusalem,
descending out of heaven from God.”</span> Rev.
21:9, 10. The husband is to love the wife as Christ
loved the church; and as the church reverences and
obeys, is faithful and subject to Christ, the wife is to
reverence, obey and be faithful and subject to her
husband. <span class="tei tei-q">“Nevertheless let every one of you in particular

Such is the true position of the wife, giving the

slavish fear, but a fear in love, like as one would
fear God whom he loved with all his heart. Fear to
purposely displease him. Fear to wilfully neglect

him. Fear to obstinately disobey him. To be in
subjection with reverence. Such words are full of
solid thought, and we would ask every wife to wisely
consider them, especially if she places any value upon
Christianity. The husband is to command in love.
She is to obey in fear. He is to govern without giving
vexation, and she is to be in subjection without
feeling herself a slave. He is to watch over her conduct
and guard her from every act that would be
damaging to her character or her soul. She is to
trust in him, and obey.

the wife in the fear of God, profess to sincerely love

the first years of its life, is due more to example than
to commandment. The influence of example upon
youthful minds is rarely comprehended. We are
commanded to be an example in faith, purity, conversation,
charity, spirit, and to be a pattern of good
works. It is the parents' duty to love their children.
Titus 2:4. Perhaps every parent thinks and is ready
to say, <span class="tei tei-q">“I love my child.”</span> True love as required by
the Bible comprehends more than you may have been
aware. They who indulge their children in a worldly
life do not love them as the Bible commands. Because
the priest Eli did not restrain his children
from the ways of sin, God sent an awful judgment
upon him. 1 Sam. 3. If parents love their children
as they should they will do the very best thing for
them. Now the instructions given in the Bible are
the safest and best to follow.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
As you looked into the face of this thine own child
did you remember the little treasure was a heritage
from the Lord? <span class="tei tei-q">“Lo, children are a heritage of the
Lord: and the fruit of the womb is his reward.”</span>
Psa. 127:3. It may be that you were unmindful of
this <span class="tei tei-q">“fruit of the womb”</span> being a gracious heritage
from God: but such it was. In the creation of man
and woman they were formed to bear offspring. When
Esau and Jacob met after their long separation and
enmity, Esau inquired, <span class="tei tei-q">“Who are those with thee?”</span>
Jacob replied, <span class="tei tei-q">“The children which God hath graciously
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page256">[pg 256]</span><a name="Pg256" id="Pg256" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
given thy servant.”</span> Gen. 33:5. Blessed and
happy is the man that can look into the face of the
newly-born and feel in his heart that this is a child
graciously given me of God.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Because children are a heritage from the Lord is
the real secret of the joy experienced in the parents'
hearts when a child is born. An angel from God's
presence anoints the spirit of man with the <span class="tei tei-q">“oil of
joy”</span> when he obeys Heaven's ordained laws of procreation.
Alas! how many husbands and wives, who
fear to meet the responsibilities involved thus upon
them seek to avert God's laws. And when a child
is conceived they, instead of rejoicing as did Rachel,
the mother of Joseph, and Mary, the mother of Jesus,
sorrow in heart, thus allowing the enemy of human
happiness to deprive them of the blessing God designed
for them.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
God, in his own mysterious way, from the mother's
life and blood is creating a new life. But did you
know that at the same time he was creating an immortal
soul? That new-born life contains an immortal
part, and very much depends upon you as to where
shall be its eternal existence. We want you to feel
this deep in your hearts. God has given into your
charge a life and a soul. When you come to appear
before him in the day of judgment then you will have
to render an account of how you have dealt with your
child. Oh, what awful responsibilities! What a
charge! God help us! With such a sacred trust, what
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page257">[pg 257]</span><a name="Pg257" id="Pg257" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
shall we do? Like she of olden time, who petitioned
the God of heaven for a child, carry him back to the
Lord and there implore grace and wisdom and guidance
from above to train these little feet in the way
that leads to endless joys.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Parents, as you look into the face of your slumbering
child, and then along down through his life, what
do you want him to become? Do you want him to
grow up to manhood a poor, delicate, frail body with
but little energy or vitality with which to meet the
sterner duties of life? Do you want him to be indolent,
shiftless, unmanly and addicted to such as will
bring him to shame, ruin and death? What! would
you picture such a life for my innocent boy? Such
a thought is instantly banished from you. With all
your heart you desire him to become a true and noble
man. You want him to be strong, full of energy
and vitality, of great mental and physical worth,
of manly ways, of pure habits, and in every way a worthy
son. Yes, that is the life you fondly picture for
your son. Well, here he lies an infant in thine arms.
He is at thy mercy. You can make of him about
what you will. You can lead him in the paths of
virtue and to a generous Christian manhood, or
you can neglect him and allow him to go to shame
and ruin. Let me say again that the life and destiny
of your child depends largely upon you. You can
make it what you will. God help and bless you.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
When your child is born then comes the care of the
little body. It must have food. It must have
air. It must have clothing. The supplying of
temporal needs is a duty that falls to the father.
May he do his duty with a will and see
that his child's health is not impaired by an insufficient
amount of clothing or of food. <span class="tei tei-q">“But if
any provide not for his own, and especially for those
of his own house, he hath denied the faith, and is
worse than an infidel.”</span> 1 Tim. 5:8. The parent that
will not industriously make use of every legitimate
means to secure temporal comforts, does not love his
child. It has been known that the awful curse of tobacco,
opium and rum, have robbed the father and
mother of parental love. Some may have become so in
love or so in bondage to tobacco that they would
rather see their child go hungry or naked than to
deprive themselves of the accursed thing.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Parents should acquaint themselves with hygienic
laws and teach them to their children. Show them
the danger of overeating, and of too frequent eating.
Parents are destroying the health of their children
by irregular feeding, and by nuts and candies. Teach
the little ones to avoid sitting in a cool place when
heated and of retaining wet clothing. Above all,
avoid giving your child tea, coffee and <span class="tei tei-q">“soothing
syrup.”</span> Paregorics and laudanums pave the way
to the formation of other bad habits. They have an
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page259">[pg 259]</span><a name="Pg259" id="Pg259" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
effect which may answer your purpose at the time,
but you gain your purpose at the cost of your child's
vitality. If your attention has ever been called to
the evil effects of such, you can not dope your children
with them without bringing condemnation to
your soul.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Good health is a great blessing, and our heavenly
Father wills us to observe natural health laws. Parents
by carelessness can in a very short time ruin the
health of their child forever. Oh, the misery and
distress originating from ill health entailed upon the
human family through the ignorance and carelessness
of parents is appalling. Had the writer's parents
compelled their child to observe health laws in
his youth he would enjoy better health to-day. By
proper care and help from God he has largely overcome
difficulties, but does not possess the strong constitution
he otherwise would.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
We kindly make an earnest appeal to all parents
to look well to the health of your children. If you
value their happiness, and a pleasant, happy home,
acquaint yourself with the laws of health, and follow
them as strictly as circumstances will allow. Many
parents care more for their children's appearance in
public than they do for their health. Mothers following
the pride of their heart instead of the laws of
health expose the bodies of their children to disease.
In public gatherings, in order to make a show of their
rich clothing, they will not wrap them sufficiently
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page260">[pg 260]</span><a name="Pg260" id="Pg260" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
to protect them from cold: they will deform the feet
of their little ones and bring them pain in after
life, because of the pride of their heart. By lacing
they will mold and shape the bodies of their daughters
after the fashion of the world, entailing upon
them disorder and disease, weakness and woe. In all
love, but without hesitancy, we declare that such
shameful treatment of children is a sin and is sufficient
of itself to destroy the soul.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Great wisdom is required in the government of children.
For parents to properly govern their children
they need that wisdom and direction which comes
from above. There are so many different natures
which must be controlled in as many different ways,
making it impossible to fix certain rules for all. However
all these different dispositions among our children
must be met. <span class="tei tei-q">“If any man lack wisdom, let
him ask of God.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Many parents ask. <span class="tei tei-q">“At what age shall we begin
to train and govern our child?”</span> Wisdom makes answer,
<span class="tei tei-q">“From the beginning.”</span> You can train your
babe to nurse regularly, say every two hours, or to
stifle his cries, you can nurse him irregularly, and
make him a cross, fretful babe by over and irregular
feeding. Your babe will sleep sweetly and soundly
upon its little bed, but you can very early accustom
it to be rocked to sleep so it will not go to sleep unless
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page261">[pg 261]</span><a name="Pg261" id="Pg261" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
it is rocked. Nature never designed that we be
tossed to and fro in order to go to sleep. What is
man's experience on board a ship in a rough sea? He
becomes dizzy, nervous and sick, and when he steps
upon the land he walks like a drunken man. The
infant's first rock in the cradle has a similar effect.
Its little muscles are strained to prevent falling. Its
brain is dashed about until it becomes dizzy, but which
it soon learns to enjoy because of the peculiar sensation.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Your little babe sees some bright object and reaches
out its little hands to take it. You know it ought not
to have it. It may injure itself with it, so you say,
<span class="tei tei-q">“No, baby can not have this.”</span> Then baby begins
to cry. You try to quiet him. You try to turn his
mind and attention somewhere else, but, no, he keeps
his eye on the forbidden object and cries the harder.
At last to quiet him you give it to him, even if you
have to hold to one end to keep him from hurting
himself. Baby has now learned a very valuable lesson,
which he is not going to forget. He has learned
that if he cries long enough and hard enough he
can obtain what he desires.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
As he grows older he becomes more determined to
have his way. When company comes you want
your boy to give the rocker to the lady, but no, the
little man prefers the rocker for himself. You endeavor
to remove him by force, but he kicks and bites
and holds tight and cries very loud, and you call him
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page262">[pg 262]</span><a name="Pg262" id="Pg262" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
a naughty boy, and give up the struggle. Then you
begin to tell the ladies about your boy, how he will
have his way and you can not do anything with him;
that you sometimes whip him, but it does not do
him any good. You are educating your child out of
your control.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
If you desire your child to obey you, be kind, loving
and firm. Scolding is never in order, but does great
harm. Unhappy and unholy is the home where children
obey only through fear. So deal with your little
ones that obedience is gained through love. So rarely
is such obedience obtained that many have concluded
it can not be accomplished. It is natural for children
to love their parents, and if parents deal with
their little ones in love and kindness they can make
home the most desirable place on earth to them.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
To rule by physical force is not government. It is
a most pitiful sight to see a child fear and tremble
before a parent's stern looks and cross words. There
is a way, though but few have found it, of mingling
tenderness with firmness that demands obedience in
respect and love. It brings a joy to the parents'
hearts to behold their child obeying willingly. By the
help of God such obedience can be obtained. Some
one may ask, <span class="tei tei-q">“Would you never punish a child?”</span>
Yes; it is sometimes necessary, but not so often as
many have supposed. Training, and not arbitrary
government is what is the more successful.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It takes but little to wound the tender feelings of
a child. It is not the angry look and cross word
only that sends the little one away in tears; but oftentimes
it is neglect. What may seem to us as a
very little thing, or small achievement, may be a very
great thing to the child, and a notice and an encouraging
word has a good and lasting effect. Your little boy
has done a piece of work, and done it poorly enough
to be sure, but to him it is done in the most artistic
style. Do not depress his spirit by showing your disapproval,
but encourage him by telling him that it
does very well for a child; then kindly help him to
see how he can make it still better.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
You should not become so absorbed in your occupation
that you can not stop to notice the newly
drawn picture. If the child's interruptions are too
frequent, in kindness teach him that papa is not to
be interrupted now. By all means show a deep interest
in your children. Help them to see that you delight
to make things pleasant for them. Do not
make them feel that they are servants. Have pleasant
conversations with them. Read some good story
to them, or better still, tell them one; not a <span class="tei tei-q">“fairy-tale,”</span>
but something real. We have seen parents who
scarcely ever spoke to their children only when reproving.
Take them with you to the meeting. Take
them with you if at all convenient when you go on
your charitable errand. Take them for a drive. Take
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page264">[pg 264]</span><a name="Pg264" id="Pg264" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
them to the woods and the fields, and there tell them
of God.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Many opportunities will be afforded for you to
show an interest and an appreciation in your child.
Give him your attention and you will win his love
and obedience and make him feel that there is freedom
at home. Neglect him, treat him with indifference,
and you will make his little heart cold and
make him feel he is your slave.

Dear parents, the only remedy we have to offer
you for this qualification is the sweet controlling influence
of saving grace. When you have gained control
of your own spirit you are far on the way to
conquer the rebellious spirit of your child. How sad
it is that a mother who loves her child will find sometimes
a feeling of hatred in her heart against it. We
have heard mothers in a time of provocation use such
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page265">[pg 265]</span><a name="Pg265" id="Pg265" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
words as these, <span class="tei tei-q">“You foolish thing;”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“You naughty

you out where the dogs will get you;”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“You do that
again and I'll give you to the bad man;”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“I'll slap
your head off;”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“I wish you were dead,”</span> etc. How
awful! Mothers, who, if their little one was sick, would
gladly sit night after night and watch by its bedside—no
slumber for those eyelids now, for baby is
very sick—when the dear one is restored to health
and provokes the mother, she uses some of the above
expressions, or similar ones.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
As you stand some night by the casket that contains
that lifeless little body, oh, what anguish at
heart as you remember the hasty words you have
spoken to that dear one. How those ugly expressions
ring in your ears. They will follow you for days in
thought and dream. How sad that the human heart
is of such disposition, but what joy to know that the
precious blood of Jesus will remove all such dispositions
and fill the heart with love and sweetness that
will enable you to deal with your child in loving
patience, even in the hour of deepest trial, and should
you be called to its death bedside you can look into the
pale face and then up to God without a sting of conscience.
Parents, be firm, but be patient with your
child. Let love shine out of every reproval and you
will find it is not so difficult to train him and govern
him as you supposed.

take him quietly and show him the evil of such things,
how it will lead to other bad things, and these to
others, and should he continue in that way he would
grow up to be a bad man. Tell him how you love him,

The mental, moral and spiritual training of children
go hand in hand. We shall speak of them under
separate chapters, but the one has a great influence
upon the other. It is true, the intellectual faculties
may be cultivated to a high degree while the moral
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page269">[pg 269]</span><a name="Pg269" id="Pg269" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
powers are unimproved, but the individual is out of
harmony with true manhood. The spiritual and
moral being may be in a fair state of health and the
mental powers very much dwarfed, but still he is
not in perfect harmony with manhood as designed by
the creative mind. Without a blending of the intellectual,
moral and spiritual forces there can be no
perfect character in the fullest sense. We do not
mean by this that man must be a philosopher or a
scientist to be a moral or spiritual man; but we mean
for man to be a perfect character in every respect
and to glorify God in the whole realm of his being,
he must cultivate every talent God has given him. The
created mental powers must be improved by right
study. In order to know and understand God we
must have a sound mind. A sound mind is helpful
to the enjoyment of grace, and grace is helpful to
the enjoyment of a sound mind; so to enjoy existence

It is through the mental powers that we acquaint
our children with God: <span class="tei tei-q">“Faith cometh by hearing.”</span>
Parents can not be too careful about the impressions
made in the mentality of their children; it may affect
their morality and spirituality in the whole of
after life. Select such books for them as will develop
the mental faculties, something that contains
food for the brain. There are certain articles of diet
that do not contain sufficient nutrition for the development
of the physical body. Children fed upon
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page270">[pg 270]</span><a name="Pg270" id="Pg270" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
such diet would become weakly. There is also a certain
kind of literature that contains no brain nutriment.
Reading such degenerates the mental powers. Stimulants
or excitants are hurtful to the physical system.
All fictitious, exciting tales are hurtful to the
mental system. We are persuaded it were better if
the unreal, fairy stories were excluded from our common
school readers and supplanted by something real.
Select such literature as is pure. Reading that produces
pure thought in the child's mind not only improves
his moral state, but furnishes the best mental
food.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Educate your children as well as you possibly can.
It is a duty you owe to them and to God. Keep before
them the ultimate object—a developed mind for
the glory of God. Encourage your children to an education.
Do not think the buying of a good book an
unnecessary expenditure. Better make a physical
sacrifice than a mental one. Keep your children
away from the physical, mental, moral and spiritual
destructive party and dance by interesting them in
sound and pure literature and providing it for them.
If your children show a disposition to love and desire
to spend the evening at the <span class="tei tei-q">“parties”</span> or the
<span class="tei tei-q">“balls,”</span> get up a <span class="tei tei-q">“reading circle”</span> or <span class="tei tei-q">“composition
exercise”</span> at home. God will bless you and reward
you in all your efforts in this direction. Much more
of importance could be said upon this subject, but
with these few suggestions we will leave the interested
and inventive mind to enlarge.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Man is an intellectual and a moral being. By his
intellectual powers he gains a knowledge of facts.
By his moral faculties he experiences a sense of
responsibility and a feeling of certain relations existing
between him and some higher power. Your
child possesses an intuitive knowledge and upon this
is where your moral training begins. The little brother
knows it is wrong to injure his little sister. He
does not have to acquire that knowledge, he knows it
intuitively. This is the foundation for your moral
training, and—of course—spiritual training naturally
hinges upon this; but we shall speak of that in a separate
chapter.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The wisest man that ever lived said, <span class="tei tei-q">“Train up a
child in the way he should go: and when he is old,
he will not depart from it.”</span> Prov. 22:6. So many
having failed, some have been almost persuaded to
doubt this man's wisdom. The saying is true: the
failures arise from the lack of understanding of how
to train properly. All the moral principles sustain a
close relation to each other; thus one moral principle
influences another, therefore the violation of one
principle makes it easier to violate a second, and the
child is carried on until he can do wrong without
any reproval of conscience.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Training should begin very early in the life of a
child. Never allow this intuitive knowledge or the
voice of conscience to be hushed by repeated wrong doing.
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page272">[pg 272]</span><a name="Pg272" id="Pg272" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
The child who does wrong should be told why it is
he feels a sense of guilt—God is displeased. Show him
how one evil leads to another, and what will be the
awful end. Call to his mind the differences in his
feelings arising from wrong doing and right doing.
With the one God is displeased, with the other he is
pleased. The way then to be happy in life is to always
do right.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
You must be indefatigable in your efforts at training.
Constant daily training is needed. As one
wrong act makes it easier to do a second wrong act,
so one right act makes it easier to do a second right
act. It is comparatively easy for the child to fall
into bad habits. Training, constant daily training
is needed to keep the little one from evil ways. Lead
him into right action. By repeating a right action
it becomes easy to perform it. You must never think
of becoming discouraged, although it appears so natural
for your child to do wrong and so difficult to get
him to do right. You must go on training, trusting
in the promise, teaching, reproving, correcting, punishing,
ever looking upward for grace and wisdom.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Be careful of your example. It exerts a powerful
influence. At one time in his life, the writer was
quick in his actions and his words. He never received
such a reproving as when one day his little
boy under a provocation acted and spoke in the
exact manner and tone of his papa. It cut to the
heart.

It may seem at times that the voice of conscience
is almost stifled, but you must hope on and labor
zealously as in the command: <span class="tei tei-q">“And thou shalt teach
them diligently unto thy children, and shalt talk of
them when them sittest in thine house, and when thou
walkest by the way, and when thou liest down, and
when thou risest up.”</span> Deut. 6:7.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Many parents seeing their young child doing or
saying something wrong often think it of not much
consequence, because the child is young and the
wrong is very slight. You do not know the power of
habit, and how one wrong, howsoever slight, leads
to a greater one. Habit has been likened to a spider's
web, which at first can be easily broken, but after
continued indulgence binds its victim as with a
strong cable, making reformation almost impossible.
The same is true of good and right conduct. At first
it may require an effort to perform a certain right
act, but after repetition it is accomplished naturally
and without thought. Therefore be vigilant in
training your child to right action, and carefully
avoid everything that would lead to evil acts or feelings.
To tease a child is to develop an angry disposition.
Some fathers think it quite laughable to
hear the little two-year-old say to its mamma, <span class="tei tei-q">“I
won't do it,”</span> but he shall afterward pay dearly for
his sport.

such education the day will probably come when he
will shake his fist at you so that it will strike like a
hammer on your heart. We have heard many parents
laughing at their little children saying <span class="tei tei-q">“smart

leading to.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Train up a child in the way he should go,”</span> comprehends
much more than many have understood.
Just recently we heard a little child being taught to
say, <span class="tei tei-q">“Peter, Peter, pumpkin eater,”</span> etc. Such
teaching is horrifying to Christian hearts. It is
better to train your child to make reply in the polite,
<span class="tei tei-q">“Yes, sir”</span> and <span class="tei tei-q">“No, sir,”</span> or, <span class="tei tei-q">“Yes, ma'am,”</span> and
<span class="tei tei-q">“No, ma'am,”</span> instead of that coarse, impolite
<span class="tei tei-q">“umgh,”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“humgh,”</span> which is no language. Remember
the first step to child training is to set the example
before them in your own life. Frequently we find
parents endeavoring to teach their children to say,
<span class="tei tei-q">“Please”</span> and <span class="tei tei-q">“Yes, sir,”</span> when they in their own
speech neglect such politeness. Your efforts will
prove fruitless.

Parents have been known to tease their little
daughter and the daughter of other parents about
some little boy companion, and their little son about

harmful. It fills the minds of their children with

and pure and the language of your children the

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page275">[pg 275]</span><a name="Pg275" id="Pg275" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

Be familiar with your child and talk to him about
his secret life. Teach him of the awful evils in the
secret lives of many children and how impure words

see to it that there is a loving confidence between you
and your child. Be familiar in telling them how
wonderfully they are made and what was the design
of God in thus creating them. Teach them what a
noble and sacred thing it is to use every member and
organ of our body to the glory of the Creator. Teach
them of the awful crime to misuse any part. Mothers,
acquaint your young daughters of the event that

By precept upon precept and by example, train
your child to grow up into a beautiful moral life.
In love restrain every immoral tendency in your

good manners. Civility and refinement are
beautiful in the life of any one, and is very closely
associated with the morals. Teach your little ones
to respect each other, to have a regard for each
other's happiness, to practise self-denial for the benefit
of others. By precept and example instill gentleness

The moral life is beautiful, but there is a higher
and more beautiful life. In the true, deep spiritual
life is found the highest degree of morality. However
we may train our children into a high standard
of moral life, and yet not attain to the spiritual. It
is reported that the homes of certain infidels are
most exemplary in moral conduct. Ancient heathen
philosophers through restraint, self-sacrifice, and
force of will attained to beautiful moral lives. But
the spiritual life, which includes the moral, is the
perfection of beauty. The life out of which the
Christ-life and character shines is the grandest and
noblest upon the earth.

Parents, bring your children to Jesus, for of such

immortal soul. This soul will exist either in happiness
or wretchedness eternally. It is so ordained in
the plan of redemption that the soul can be brought
into possession of spiritual life, which, if retained,
insures its eternal bliss. He who has attained to a
high degree of morality through the force of human
will holds communion only with the better qualities
of manhood, all of which must perish. He who has
attained to spirituality holds communion with God
and heavenly things. He does not trust to human
powers, but in the power of the divine life.

Moral life will not admit us into the paradise above.
We must possess spiritual life—the life of Christ. It
is well to train our children in the way of good
morals with a view to leading them into the spiritual
life. Then it is necessary to lead them into the spiritual
life to aid in the moral training. Comparatively
few parents have accomplished any great results in
the moral training of their children without divine
assistance. In the moral derangement of our children
the inward tendency to immorality makes it
impossible to educate them to a true and perfect
standard of morality without God's aid. Have we
and our children no other source of strength to do
battle with the evil passions but the force of the
human will? Who has succeeded in subduing or
controlling an angry disposition in themselves or
their children to the extent that there is no impatient
speech or abrupt action, by their own will power?
We admit that some men—as the ancient heathen
philosophers—have succeeded in educating themselves
to a high standard of morality by using all
the power of the human will as a vigilant police force
and carefully avoiding occasions of temptation. It
is said of one of these philosophers that in order to
absent himself from the races and games and bull-fights
and other worldly gatherings he would only
shave one-half of his face, thereby making himself
too ridiculous in appearance to assemble among men.
Such is the struggle to attain any moral excellence
without divine assistance.

Children should be taught what sin is, and of
God's judgments against it, and as early in life as
possible be led by instruction and seeking the aid of
the Holy Spirit into a Christian experience. Some
seem to think that children have no correct ideas of
God, and never feel the influence of his Spirit. In
this they may be mistaken. The tender heart of a
child very often receives a deep and sacred impression
by the Holy Spirit. Were we watchful and took
advantage of these seasons to tell them of God and
heaven we would be workers together with him, and
he would reward us by faithful children. The communication
of the Spirit with the hearts of children
is more wonderful and frequent than we may sometimes
understand. A lady recently told us that her
parents never taught her to pray, but very early in
life she was inclined by the Holy Spirit to kneel at
her bedside and pray when unobserved.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Who is the reader that can not remember instances
in his early life when he felt the influence of some
good spirit and had thoughts of God? Had he in
those tender childhood days been rightly instructed
he could have been led into the beautiful walks of a
Christian life. We remember a child of less than ten
years of age, who, hearing his father using bad language,
fell upon his knees and clasping his arms
around his father told him of his sin and besought
him to pray for forgiveness.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
A lady writer in one of her excellent works
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page279">[pg 279]</span><a name="Pg279" id="Pg279" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
(<span class="tei tei-q">“Mothers' Counsel to Their Sons”</span>), records the instance
of a little girl of four and a half years who
felt the guilt of sin, and by her Christian mother was
led to Jesus, and there she was blessed by him, even
to the witnessing of his Spirit that her sins were
gone and she was his child. The child was at one
time moved to plead with an unsaved relative to come
to Jesus. She lived triumphant in the sweetness of
redeeming grace until the age of fifteen, when her
mission on earth was ended and she went to her home
in heaven. Oh, how glorious! What if that mother,
when this child came expressing her sense of guilt,
had not instructed her in the ways of salvation? In
all probability it would have resulted in a lost soul.

When our children are brought into a Christian
experience the victory is only partly won; life lies
before them with its temptations. Many are the allurements
to turn those young feet into worldly paths.
We have witnessed the bright, happy conversion of
many children. We have seen their countenances
beaming with the light and joy of Christian love and
heard their voices ring with spiritual praise, only to
soon yield to the influence of the world and lose that
sincere devotion to God. This is not the inevitable
course, thank God, but it is the course of many. To
teach our children the fear of God and enable them
to retain in their hearts a deep reverence and devotion
to him has been a subject of much prayer with
us. We find the Christian life is a warfare. There
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page280">[pg 280]</span><a name="Pg280" id="Pg280" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
are temptations to be resisted, there are watchings
and prayings, there must be a constant looking upward
to God for his aid and direction.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
One trouble with many parents has been that as
soon as their children were converted they seemed to
think the battle was over and the victory was won,
when really the battle was only begun. The first
thing necessary in keeping our budding <span class="tei tei-q">“olive
plants”</span> in deep spirituality is to keep very spiritual
ourselves. Now whatever means are necessary to
promote a growth of spirituality in our hearts, the
same means are necessary to develop and deepen the
spiritual life of our children. A habitual effort to
cultivate a deeper sense of the divine presence is necessary
and one of the most beautiful employments of
the sanctified heart. Those reverential feelings toward
God must daily become stronger. Those inmost affections
of the soul must reach out with greater
yearnings and deeper longings toward the Holy One.
A benevolent regard in our hearts for our fellow men
must become stronger and more true. O beloved, if
you would have your child to grow up into a beautiful
Christian character you must teach him to suppress
every selfish feeling, to banish every idle, careless
thought, and to resist all temptations to envy or
impatience. The purest of meditations must be entertained.
We and they must be strictly disciplined by
the sacred Scriptures, <span class="tei tei-q">“Watch and pray.”</span> Spiritual
prayer unfolds the life into the beautiful life of God
as the bud unfolds into the blooming rose.

Nowhere is Christianity more effectual and more
beautiful than in the home life. Nowhere is the power
of divine love so truly manifested as in a sincere
Christian home. We will set a picture before you. A
father and mother with their children are grouped together
for the evening worship. The father out of the
deep affections of his soul, in spiritual tones, speaks of
God and his holy commandment. A tear of gratitude
and joy is glistening in the mother's affectionate eye.
The children's faces are beaming with admiration as
they hear extolled the character of Christ. They kneel
in prayer; a holy awe and sacredness rests upon the
scene; their prayers arise as sweet incense into the nostrils
of God and delight his great heart.

Such a scene as we have pictured only fitly represents
a true Christian home. The father is all tenderness
and love to his wife and children. He is kind and
sympathetic. He regards his wife as the weaker vessel
and is mindful of her happiness. The wife deeply
reverences her husband. Affection and appreciation
sparkle in her eye. To attend to the husband's wishes
is her delight. They love their children and in gentleness
are bringing them up in the nurture and admonition
of the Lord. The children love each other and
are kind and self-denying. They obey their parents
through love. Alas! such a family is rarely found
upon this sin-cursed earth. But such is taught and
commanded in the Bible, and it is possible.

Masters should give unto their servants that which

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The Word of the Lord may not denominate in plain
terms every particular sin and evil practise man may
engage in; however there are general terms and principles
of righteousness that prohibit and condemn
every possible sinful act man may perform. The
words card-parties, picnics, fairs, shows and theaters
are not found in the writings of the apostles; however
indulgence in these is <span class="tei tei-q">“revelry,”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“living in
pleasure,”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“rioting”</span> and worldliness, of which the
Scriptures say the participants do not love God and
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page288">[pg 288]</span><a name="Pg288" id="Pg288" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
can never enter heaven. Also the terms <span class="tei tei-q">“whisky,”</span>
<span class="tei tei-q">“alcohol,”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“opium,”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“morphine,”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“tobacco,”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“tea,”</span>
and <span class="tei tei-q">“coffee,”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“secret vice,”</span> etc., are not made use of
by the New Testament writers. They are included,
however, in the general term <span class="tei tei-q">“lust of the flesh.”</span> To
make mention of all the things that may be done as
a lust of the flesh would make a lengthy catalogue indeed.
Anything, no matter what it may be, if done
to satisfy the lust of the flesh is very damaging to
spiritual life.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Dearly beloved, I beseech you as strangers and
pilgrims, abstain from fleshly lusts, which war against
the soul.”</span> 1 Pet. 2:11. <span class="tei tei-q">“This I say then, walk in the
Spirit, and ye shall not fulfil the lust of the flesh.
For the flesh lusteth against the Spirit, and the
Spirit against the flesh: and these are contrary the
one to the other: so that ye can not do the things that
ye would.”</span> Gal. 5:16, 17. <span class="tei tei-q">“For if ye live after the
flesh ye shall die: but if ye through the Spirit do
mortify the deeds of the body, ye shall live.”</span> Rom.
8:13.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
By these tests we plainly understand the <span class="tei tei-q">“flesh”</span>
to be antagonistical to the Spirit. God has created
us with a fleshly nature, or made us a fleshly being.
He has also created things for the sustenance of
this fleshly life. He has created food and drink for
man's use. A proper use of these is not a lust of
the flesh. An improper use may be considered lust.
Our eating and drinking should be to the glory of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page289">[pg 289]</span><a name="Pg289" id="Pg289" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
God. The primary object in our eating should be
to sustain life and promote health and strength, that
we may be able to labor for and glorify God.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
If we have a pure and undefiled conscience and
are conscientious before God, and fully comprehend
that we are not our own, but that we are God's property
and that we should glorify him in our body and
our spirit, we then most certainly would eat and drink
such things to the extent of our knowledge as are
most conducive to development of physical energy,
and mental activity. It is not a lust of the flesh if we
eat and drink to the glory of God. Temperance in
natural God-given food and drink is the law of Heaven.
It is of surfeiting that the Son of God warns us
to beware. Luke 21:34. There are a great many
things in creation which God never designed for the
use of man as food and drink. Temperance does not
mean a moderate use of these things. Their use is
wholly forbidden.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Again man may by certain processes change the
natural into an unnatural and make it in opposition
to God's law. Because man has not always had the
glory of God as his object in eating, drinking, and
clothing, but became intemperate in the things which
he allows, many have through the lust of the flesh
been led to indulge in things from which the Word
of God and the laws of health demand total abstinence.
The injurious indulgences are so many and various
as to furnish subject enough for volumes. We can
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page290">[pg 290]</span><a name="Pg290" id="Pg290" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
only mention briefly the ones that are most generally
indulged in, and which are destroying soul and body.

<h3 class="tei tei-head" style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 2.40em; margin-top: 2.40em"><span style="font-size: 120%">Alcohols.</span></h3>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
All whiskies, rums, brandies, and fermented wines
contain a certain amount of alcohol. It consists of
hydrogen, carbon, and oxygen, and is a powerful antiseptic.
It is the intoxicating ingredient found in
distilled liquors. An appetite for spirituous liquors
is unnatural. It is true this appetite may be inherited,
but because the child apparently takes naturally
to these strong drinks is no proof they are a natural
drink.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The word alcohol is not used by any of the writers
of the New Testament. Paul speaks of wine and says
that the bishop must be a man <span class="tei tei-q">“not given to wine”</span>
(1 Tim. 3:3; Titus 1:7), and of the deacon, <span class="tei tei-q">“not
given to much wine.”</span> Ver. 8. To the church at Ephesus
he says, <span class="tei tei-q">“Be not drunk with wine, wherein is excess:
but be filled with the Spirit.”</span> Eph. 5:18.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
He recommends wine to Timothy: <span class="tei tei-q">“Drink no longer
water, but use a little wine for thy stomach's sake
and thine often infirmities.”</span> 1 Tim. 5:23. There is
nothing in this text for the consolation of the wine-bibber.
The professed follower of Christ who loves to
sip the wine-cup, and by this text persuades himself
to believe he is not violating God's law, wrests
it to his own hurt. That Timothy had some stomach
trouble is very evident from this text. We are not
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page291">[pg 291]</span><a name="Pg291" id="Pg291" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
ready to admit that it was fermented wine Paul advised
him to use. It often happens that water, especially
if it is not pure, will distress a diseased
stomach. This wine was recommended as a hygienic
law. When an individual is troubled with constipation
he will find bread made from unbolted wheat
flour to be much more healthful for him than bread
made from fine white flour. We would not advise the
use of this merely as a luxury, nor as a medicine, but
as a common-sense law of health. The juice of the
grape contains a considerable portion of water, so
much that one can get all the water the system requires
and not drink the sweet juice to an excess. From
the text it is natural to conclude that water was hurtful
to Timothy, since he is advised to drink no longer
water.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In cities and certain countries travelers often find
the water disagreeable and unhealthful to them. It
would be wisdom to use unfermented wine, or boil the
water and add the juice of a lemon or some fruit to
make it palatable. It would be very unwise for us
on such an occasion to justify ourselves in the use of
narcotic and fermented drinks. They are as injurious
to the stomach as impure water, and were we compelled
to drink either, we would feel more in God's order to
trust him to counteract the poison in the water rather
than the poison of fermented wines and narcotic teas
and coffees.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The drinking in moderation or <span class="tei tei-q">“not to excess”</span> of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page292">[pg 292]</span><a name="Pg292" id="Pg292" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
unfermented wine is healthful, and in harmony with
divine laws: but total abstinence from spirituous
liquors is the command of God. While alcohol, whisky,
and brandy are words not used in the New Testament
their use is none the less objectionable and
sinful. These ardent spirits produce an effect called
drunkenness, and the Scriptures class drunkenness
with the works of the flesh, and declare that they
which do such things shall not inherit the kingdom
of God. Gal. 5:19-21. The reader will only have
to refer to any authentic medical or hygienic work to
learn of the injurious effects of alcohol upon the human
system.

<span class="tei tei-q">“Wine is a mocker, strong drink is raging: and
whosoever is deceived thereby is not wise.”</span> Prov.

contentions? who hath babbling? who hath wounds

tarry long at the wine: they that go to seek mixed

We would say again that in all things God has given

Very few people especially among the religious
class, are not willing to admit that drunken debauchery
and carousal is altogether outside the realms of
Christianity, and can only be engaged in by those
wholly devoid of the love and grace of God. It is
however a source of astonishment to the pure-hearted
child of God to find so many professing Christ, yet
unwilling to admit that tobacco using is a lust of the
flesh. Oftentimes when speaking to a man concerning
the tobacco habit, he will say, The word tobacco is not
mentioned in the Bible. This is true. As we have
before said, the word alcohol is not found in the
Scriptures, but its effects upon the human system
are mentioned, and no one can thus affect his body
without placing his soul in great danger.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Tobacco is not mentioned in the Scripture, but its
effects are, and we are positively commanded to remedy
such effects. Paul says, <span class="tei tei-q">“Having therefore these
promises, dearly beloved, let us cleanse ourselves from
all filthiness of the flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness
in the fear of God.”</span> 2 Cor. 7:1. One effect of tobacco
using is <span class="tei tei-q">“filthiness,”</span> from which we are commanded
to cleanse ourselves. But few people are not
ready to admit that using tobacco is a filthy habit.
Then since the Word of God condemns filthiness, the
tobacco habit stands condemned. It is indeed a sin-seared
and tobacco-stunned conscience that denies the
use of tobacco being a lust of the flesh. It can be
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page294">[pg 294]</span><a name="Pg294" id="Pg294" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
nothing else but a fleshly lust. How frequently the
lust of the flesh is condemned in the Holy Scriptures.
It wars against the soul. It is enmity against God.
It lusteth against the Spirit.

Dear reader, will you listen to reason and truth?
We are aware how difficult it is for man to see and
acknowledge the truth when some cherished idol
stands between him and the truth. It is not a difficult
thing to help him to comprehend the sinfulness
of some evil thing which his heart is not set upon,
but he is blinded to any sin in the cherished object
of his affections.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Recently there were in a meeting two middle aged
ladies. One of them was fashionably dressed, while
the other was uncommonly plain in her apparel. The
lady in the plain dress was addicted to the habit of
using snuff. The lady in the fashionable dress abhorred
such a filthy practise. When the Word of
God was read on the comeliness and plainness of female
attire, the lady in the plain dress smiled and
nodded assent. The lady whose heart was set on costly
apparel, expressed a rejection of God's Word in her
countenance and manner. In the discourse the subject
was changed from the wearing of gay clothing
to the practise of tobacco using. When the habit of
using snuff was mentioned the plain lady's smile was
turned to a sneer, and the fashionable lady's sneer
was turned to a smile. Afterwards in conversation
the fashionable lady said she believed it was a sin to
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page295">[pg 295]</span><a name="Pg295" id="Pg295" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
use snuff, but she could not see any evil in wearing
gay and fine clothing. The plain lady said she thought
it was a sin to wear such plumed hats and beaded
dresses, but she could see no harm in using snuff.
This proved to us what we have before mentioned, that
it is difficult for man to see any sin in his idol.

If you are not very careful you will be seeking to
justify yourself in your indulgences, though they be
wrong. So if you, dear reader, will lay down all
prejudice, with a heart open to reason and truth, we
will consider with you the use of tobacco. We claim,
first, that tobacco is injurious to health. The Bible
tells us that we are not our own, but are bought with
a price; therefore we should glorify God in our body
and spirit which are his. 1 Cor. 6:19, 20. Also that
whether we eat or drink, or whatsoever we do, we
should do all to the glory of God. 1 Cor. 10:31. We
can not indulge in anything injurious to the health
of the body without incurring the displeasure of God.
Now we frequently meet strong looking, and apparently
healthy men, who have used tobacco for several
years. Such are often ready to say, <span class="tei tei-q">“Tobacco does
not hurt me.”</span> They are honest in this. Being strongly
constituted the poison of tobacco has not as yet succeeded
in affecting them to a noticeable extent. Sooner
or later, however, it will make its awful sting to be
felt. Some men may expose themselves to the most
inclement weather for years and experience no visible
injurious effects; however, slowly, but surely, such
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page296">[pg 296]</span><a name="Pg296" id="Pg296" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
negligence is undermining the general health, and the
pains of his old days will repay him for the fool-hardiness
of his youth.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
We have read may works on hygiene, and never a
one but what has without hesitancy pronounced tobacco
and alcohol very injurious poisons. We have
a few by us and will give you some short quotations.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“It tends to debilitate the organs, it weakens the
memory. By the use of tobacco we entail upon ourselves
a whole train of nervous maladies. It will bow
down to the earth an intellect of giant strength and
make it grind in bondage like Samson shorn of his
strength.”</span>—<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hitchcock.</span></span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“It impairs the functions of the brain, clouds the
understanding, and enfeebles the memory.”</span>—<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Dr.
Stevens.</span></span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“In whatever way it is used, tobacco is a narcotic
and a poison. Its injurious effects are due to its active
principle called <span class="tei tei-q">‘nicotine,’</span> which is of itself
a narcotic poison. The extent to which the body may
be injured by tobacco depends upon its moderate or
excessive use. Even in moderate use it is hurtful to
young persons, and by no means free from harm to
adults. It produces an artificial exhaustion, as it were,
of the nerve-centers. It certainly does no good, even
when used in moderation. Tobacco produces functional
derangement of the nervous system, palpitation
of the heart, certain forms of dyspepsia, and more
or less irritation of the throat and lungs. Sometimes
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page297">[pg 297]</span><a name="Pg297" id="Pg297" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
after long smoking, a sudden sensation of dizziness,
with a momentary loss of consciousness is experienced.
At other times, if walking, there is a sudden sensation
of falling forward, or as if the feet were touching
cotton-wool. While the stomach is empty, protracted
smoking will often produce a feeling of nausea, accompanied
with a headache. The external application of
tobacco to chafed surfaces, and even to the healthy
skin, will occasion severe, and sometimes fatal results.
A tea made of tobacco and applied to the skin
has caused death in three hours. A tobacco enema
has resulted fatally within a few minutes. The excessive
smoking of tobacco has been known to produce
violent and fatal effects. Nicotine is one of the most
rapidly fatal poisons known. It rivals prussic acid
in this respect. It takes about one minute for a single
drop of nicotine to kill a fullgrown cat. A single drop
has killed a rabbit in three minutes. The old tobacco-user
is often cross, irritable and liable to outbursts of
passion. The memory is also quite often impaired
for the same reason. The narcotic principle, the
deadly nicotine, has become soaked into the delicate
nerve-pulp, retarding its nutrition. The nerve-centers
are no longer able to hoard up their usual amount
of vital energy.”</span>—<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Young Folk's Physiology.</span></span>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Thus we could go on and quote volumes, if need be,
but we will close our quotations with the words of
Dr. Fowler, as quoted by W. J. Henry in <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Tobacco
and Its Effects</span></span>.”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“The actual loss of intellectual

power which tobacco has hitherto occasioned, and is
still causing in this Christian nation, is immense. How
much so, it is impossible to calculate. Many a man
who might have been respectable and useful has sunk
into obscurity and buried his talent in the earth.
This commands a consideration of deepest interest
to every philanthropist, patriot and Christian in the
land, and especially to all our youth. We live in a
time and under circumstances which call for the exertion
of all our intellectual strength, cultivated, improved
and sanctified to the highest measure of possibility.
Error, ignorance and sin must be met and
vanquished by light and love. The eyes of the angels
are upon us. The eye of God is upon us. Shall we
fetter and paralyze our intellectual capabilities for
the sake of enjoying the paltry pleasure of tasting
the most loathsome and destructive weed in the whole
vegetable kingdom?”</span> Oh, for shame!
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Tobacco is not a natural food. No one ever thinks
of giving it to their children as a food. It is a habit,
something to be acquired. Whatever God has given
us as food for the sustenance of the body is natural
with us and we do not have to become habituated to
its use. Where is the individual that will deny that
it is a habit? It must be, since it has to be acquired
or learned. Who will say it is a good habit? Who
will deny that it is a bad habit? Do you not think
it much better that we as moral citizens, and much
more as professed Christians, leave off our bad habits?

You must answer me. Is it not a habit? Is it good or
bad? What shall your answer be in the judgment-day?
God will hold us responsible for the use we are
making of the money he has permitted us to acquire
in this world. He says, <span class="tei tei-q">“Wherefore do ye spend
money for that which is not bread?”</span> Isa. 55:2. Does
it not savor more of the principle and spirit of Christianity
to use our money in feeding and clothing the
poor, than in consuming it in this unhealthful, unsightly,
unclean, and ungodly lust? Do you not believe
that when you shall have come to that bright land
beyond the grave, that you would have more treasures
there if all the money you have spent for tobacco had
been used to help the poor along the weary way of
life? O fellow mortal, how can you chew and smoke
and snuff and spit your money away, while thousands
are starving for bread, and millions are going to an
eternal wretchedness for the want of gospel light?
Do not think that God will not punish you for your
selfishness.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
God will hold us responsible for the example we set
before the youth of the land and the children of our
home. Jesus says to the Christian, <span class="tei tei-q">“Let your light
so shine before men that they may see your good works
and glorify your Father which is in heaven.”</span> Mat. 5:16.
What kind of a light is the tobacco-user letting
shine to this world? Can he say to all, <span class="tei tei-q">“Follow me
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page300">[pg 300]</span><a name="Pg300" id="Pg300" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
in this habit”</span>? Would he advise the pure, innocent
prattler upon his knee to chew or smoke the filthy
thing? No man can indulge in one thing that he can
not with clear conscience say to the whole world, <span class="tei tei-q">“Follow
me in,”</span> and stand clear and uncondemned before
God in judgment. The Bible tells us, <span class="tei tei-q">“In everything
give thanks.”</span> Who feels like thanking God they have
acquired the tobacco habit? The Bible tells us that
<span class="tei tei-q">“whatsoever you do in word or deed, do all to the
glory of God.”</span> But very few have become so depraved
as to say they can glorify God in tobacco using.
Here we behold the sublime wonders of redeeming
grace. This world lost in sin, mankind was bound by
passions, appetites, desires and dispositions with
which they could not glorify God, Jesus, full of grace
and truth, came from heaven to cleanse man, to save
him from everything with which he could not show
forth his Maker's praise. Halleluiah!

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
We feel like giving you a bit of our experience before
closing this subject. For several years we were
bound hand and foot by the hideous monster—Tobacco.
We repeatedly tried to extricate ourselves from
his iron grasp, but tried in vain. Resolution upon
resolution was made. The plug was frequently thrown
away only to be shortly afterward searched for or
replaced by another one. How the devil's power
ground me beneath his hoof of steel. Awful slavery,
terrible bondage! We often express our thankfulness
for a free country, but who is free? Of all the many
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page301">[pg 301]</span><a name="Pg301" id="Pg301" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
sins that lay upon my soul, none seemed so heavy as
the tobacco sin. In a time of danger or fright our
first thought would be of tobacco, and we feared and
trembled before God. In a time of storm when the
lightning would flash and the thunder roll we would
vow to the Lord that if he would keep us through the
storm we would use tobacco no more. But when the
clouds had rolled away and the sun shone out so peacefully,
our tyrannical master would scourge us beneath
his heavy yoke, and we would yield to his demands.
For several months we thus fought against
this monster only to be conquered, until early one
October morning when all alone we earnestly besought
the God of heaven to come to our rescue. We
confessed our sins to him and plead for mercy. He
heard our prayer and blotted out all our transgressions.
He filled our soul with such a wondrous glory
that full two weeks had passed before we thought of
tobacco, and when we did we loathed it more than
we had ever loved it. Eight years have passed and
still we are free. Since the day we were saved we have
no more desired it than if we never had used it. <span class="tei tei-q">“If
the Son therefore shall make you free, ye shall be
free indeed.”</span> John 8:36.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The habit of eating opium is fast increasing. We
are told that thousands of tons are used annually
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page302">[pg 302]</span><a name="Pg302" id="Pg302" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
in smoking and chewing in different parts of the
world. Over half a million pounds are consumed by
the opium eaters of our own country. It is a lust of
the flesh and classed among the things which if we do
we can never enter heaven. It is because it is a sin
that will bar you forever from the land of eternal
rest, that prompts us to add a few words of warning.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Like alcohol and tobacco, the word opium does not
appear in the Scriptures, but that it is a sinful lust
but very few will deny. Opium is the dried juice of
the white poppy. Morphine is a powder made from
opium. Laudanum is made by soaking opium in alcohol.
The custom of drugging infants and children
with <span class="tei tei-q">“Soothing Cordials”</span> is shameful and sinful. The
<span class="tei tei-q">“soothing”</span> effect is produced by the opium the drug
contains. It is exceedingly dangerous. One writer
has said that it is very certain that many infants
annually perish from this single cause. Any work on
hygiene or common school physiology will describe the
effect of opium upon the human system.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But the injurious effects of these stimulants and
poisons upon the physical health is not the primary
cause for speaking against their use in this little work.
It is because such is not a gospel light. No one can
indulge in such practises and be a light in the world
in this shining gospel day. Such sinful deeds of the
flesh are but the works of darkness and denounced by
the writers of the New Testament.

The greatest desire of the true, devoted Christian
is to glorify God in all that he does. No one who is
careless and unobservant about his manner of life
can prosper in the things of God. He who is desirous
of being a shining light for Jesus in this world is careful
that all about him is to the glory of God. He will
so govern or rule his life, by God's grace, he will
so subject his appetites and passions, that his whole
conduct in every respect will be an adornment of the
doctrine of God his Savior. His or her dress will
be in perfect accord with the Bible, no worldly air
will linger in his behavior; even his eating and drinking
will be such as is glorifying to God. You show
me an individual that is careless about his diet, led by
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page304">[pg 304]</span><a name="Pg304" id="Pg304" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
an unrestrained appetite in eating food highly seasoned
and flavored with spices, cinnamons, peppers,
and mustards, or freely eating of rich cakes, pastries
and puddings, or in drinking of teas and coffees, and
I will show you one in whom the ebb of spiritual life
is very weak and low. It is true, to leave off eating
condiments and drinking stimulants alone will not
make you spiritual, but it is a certain fact that if you
attain to any great degree of spiritual life you will
abandon the use of these things. It is well known
among the true children of God that the most spiritual,
and those of the greatest faith do not use tea
nor coffee.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Those who walk in close communion with God are
careful to preserve their physical health. When one
continues using a certain article of food and drink
because it is pleasing to the taste, and yet hurtful to
the body, he will soon by such selfishness destroy his
spiritual life. <span class="tei tei-q">“Whether therefore ye eat or drink,
or whatsoever ye do, do all to the glory of God.”</span> 1 Cor.
10:31. <span class="tei tei-q">“But I keep under my body, and bring
it into subjection.”</span> 1 Cor. 9:27. <span class="tei tei-q">“For if ye live after
the flesh, ye shall die: but if ye through the Spirit
do mortify the deeds of the body, ye shall live.”</span> Rom.
8:13. <span class="tei tei-q">“Dearly beloved, I beseech you as strangers
and pilgrims, abstain from fleshly lusts, which war
against the soul.”</span> 1 Pet. 2:11. <span class="tei tei-q">“This I say then, Walk

Christ, and make not provision for the flesh, to fulfil
the lusts thereof.”</span> Rom. 13:14. The lust of the flesh
as used in these and many other texts includes the
use of alcohol, opium, tobacco, tea and coffee. So we
have not departed from the Word of God, which is
a lamp unto our feet and a light unto our path, when
writing on these subjects. Those who most perfectly
manifest the life of Christ, those who are the
most brilliant spiritual reflectors, do not indulge in
such narcotics. If you value your spiritual prosperity
make these sayings subjects of earnest prayer before
rejecting them.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
When we speak of secret sins many are ready to
charge us with immodesty. It is those who indulge
in those secret evils that blush the deepest when they
are publicly mentioned. There are many habits and
indulgences of man that the pure-hearted Christian
feels it is a shame to speak of publicly, yet his love
for fettered, perishing souls moves him to look up to
God for a modesty and delicacy of speech that will
not in any sense corrupt the mind of the pure, who
may read, and yet in terms sufficiently plain to reveal
these sins and bring deliverance to many. As we
have before said, temperance is a law of heaven. For
the propagation of the race, God has implanted in his
creatures, male and female, a passion for sexual connection.
This desire in the nature of mankind is
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page306">[pg 306]</span><a name="Pg306" id="Pg306" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
really the highest and most sacred. By it this world
is being populated with souls bound on toward an eternity.
This passion legitimately indulged to the glory
of God is one of the most sacred, holy and pure.
Since it is the highest and noblest of all the faculties
of our being, its abuse must be the very lowest and
unclean in the depravity of man.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
That this sacred passion has been most degradingly
abused is witnessed to upon almost every hand. If
man could behold in one scene the awful consequences
of this abuse it would be the most beastly and hellish
that could possibly be pictured. The misery, wretchedness
and woe entailed upon mortals by these secret
indulgences is untold. It is a lust of the flesh that
brings disease upon the body, destroys the vitality of
human life and sows the seeds of death in the soul,
which shall be harvested in the eternal fires of torment.
These sins of the dark have gone far to obscure the
pure light of a Christian life. <span class="tei tei-q">“Ye are the light of
the world,”</span> can never be spoken of those who yield
to the temptations of this monster vice. The Moon
in her clear reflection of the Sun is unspotted by such
evils. Young reader, have you any admiration for a
pure life? Does there not slumber in the better faculties
of your nature a love and esteem for the virtuous
walks of life? What is nobler or more heavenly here
upon the earth than a pure, untarnished soul? Oh,
the sublimity of a Christian life! A youth or maiden
with pure affections and holy desires, seeking after
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page307">[pg 307]</span><a name="Pg307" id="Pg307" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the character of God, is the admiration of angels. As
God at one time said in the delight of his heart to
Satan, <span class="tei tei-q">“Hast thou considered my servant Job, that
there is none like him in the earth, a perfect and an
upright man, one that feareth God and escheweth
evil?”</span> so the lovely queen Virtue can say to the
hideous monster Vice, <span class="tei tei-q">“Hast thou beheld my admiring
youth and maiden? There is none like them in all
the earth, ones that love chastity and escheweth evil
indulgences.”</span>

That the New Testament teaches a trinity in the
Godhead is made obvious in Eph. 4:4-6. <span class="tei tei-q">“There is
one body, and one Spirit, even as ye are called in
one hope of your calling; one Lord, one faith, one
baptism, one God and Father of all, who is above all,
and through all, and in you all.”</span> Also in Mat. 28:19:
<span class="tei tei-q">“Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing
them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page308">[pg 308]</span><a name="Pg308" id="Pg308" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of the Holy Ghost.”</span> And in 1 Pet. 1:2: <span class="tei tei-q">“Elect according
to the foreknowledge of God the Father,
through sanctification of the Spirit, unto obedience
and sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ.”</span> Jude
20, 21: <span class="tei tei-q">“But ye, beloved, building up yourselves on
your most holy faith, praying in the Holy Ghost,
keep yourselves in the love of God, looking for the
mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ unto eternal life.”</span>
But the most indubitable text upon this subject is
1 John 5:7: <span class="tei tei-q">“For there are three that bear record

God in olden time spoke audibly to his people. Such
an order of things ended when Jesus came. His mission
in that respect was accomplished. He came in
the flesh as the Son, and conquering sin and the
grave through death and resurrection, he ascended to
the Father. His mission as a sacrifice was completed.
He now comes in the Spirit. Christ in speaking of the
Holy Spirit's coming, says, <span class="tei tei-q">“I will come to you.”</span>
John 14:18. Thus the Spirit is Christ or God in another
personage. It is the Holy Spirit that now talks
to men. He teaches, interprets, guides, comforts and reproves.
The children of God once knew God by his
audible voice. They know him now by the voice of
the Holy Spirit. You show me a man that denies the
Holy Spirit, and I will show you a man that does not
know God. The terms Holy Ghost and God are used

Some have erroneously taught that the Holy Spirit

the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost.”</span> 1 John
5:7. Is not this plain enough to stop the mouths of

The office of the Holy Spirit. He is everywhere
termed the Holy Spirit. It is true. Christ is holy,
and God is holy, but this term is especially applied to
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page312">[pg 312]</span><a name="Pg312" id="Pg312" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the Spirit, because his particular mission is to restore
mankind to holiness. Holiness and sanctification, so
far as they apply to a state, are synonymous terms.
The Holy Spirit is the sanctifier. Rom. 15:16. This
is the especial mission and prime work of the Holy
Spirit. Much is involved in the work of sanctification.
In this is the destruction of carnality and division,
and consequently the unifying of the children of God.
The Holy Spirit is the agency in answering the prayer
of the Savior: <span class="tei tei-q">“Neither pray I for these alone, but
for them also which shall believe on me through their
word: that they all may be one.”</span> John 17:20, 21.
Sanctification is the work which effects this oneness.
<span class="tei tei-q">“For both he that sanctifieth and they who are sanctified
are all of one: for which cause he is not ashamed
to call them brethren.”</span> Heb. 2:11. Holiness and unity
accomplished by the Holy Spirit are the two most
sublime themes in the New Testament. Nothing accomplished
in the mission of the Holy Spirit is more
glorifying to God.

name Jesus or Savior (see margin of Mat. 1:21), because
he should save his people from their sins. He
was both God and man. Born of a woman, he was
human. Conceived by the Holy Spirit, he was divine.
As God, he was not subject to temptation, <span class="tei tei-q">“for God

He is one with God the Father. <span class="tei tei-q">“I and my Father
are one.”</span> John 10:30. Because of his divinity he is
eternal. <span class="tei tei-q">“I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and
the ending.”</span> Rev. 1:8. He is omnipotent. <span class="tei tei-q">“I am
Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the ending,
saith the Lord, which is, and which was, and which
is to come, the Almighty.”</span> He is able to subdue all
things unto himself. Phil. 3:21. <span class="tei tei-q">“All power is given
unto me in heaven and in earth.”</span> Mat. 28:18. He is
omnipresent. <span class="tei tei-q">“For where two or three are gathered
together in my name, there am I in the midst of
them.”</span> Mat. 18:20. <span class="tei tei-q">“Lo, I am with you alway, even
unto the end of the world.”</span> Mat. 28:20. He is omniscient.
<span class="tei tei-q">“He saith unto him the third time, Simon, son
of Jonas, lovest thou me? Peter was grieved because
he said unto him the third time, Lovest thou me? And
he said unto him, Lord thou knowest all things; thou
knowest that I love thee.”</span> John 21:17. <span class="tei tei-q">“Now we
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page314">[pg 314]</span><a name="Pg314" id="Pg314" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
are sure that thou knowest all things.”</span> John 16:30.
He is immutable. <span class="tei tei-q">“Jesus Christ the same yesterday,
and to-day, and forever.”</span> Heb. 13:8.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
His mission to this world was to be offered as a
sacrifice for the sins of this world. <span class="tei tei-q">“So Christ was
once offered to bear the sins of many.”</span> Heb. 9:28.
God prepared a body for his Son which he could bring
as a sacrifice for the sins of many. <span class="tei tei-q">“But a body hast
thou prepared me.”</span> Heb. 10:5. Truly, <span class="tei tei-q">“without controversy
great is the mystery of godliness: God was
manifest in the flesh, justified in the Spirit, seen of
angels, preached unto the Gentiles, believed on in the
world, received up into glory.”</span> 1 Tim. 3:16. The
writers of the Gospels record the event of his crucifixion.
On the cross he cried, <span class="tei tei-q">“It is finished.”</span> His
mission was completed, the sacrifice was made, the
blood was shed. The blood has a great atoning power,
the devastation caused by sin is covered by the blood.
It destroys the works of the devil.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Provision was made by the atoning blood for sickness
as well as for sin. <span class="tei tei-q">“When the even was come, they
brought unto him many that were possessed with
devils: and he cast out the spirits with his word, and
healed all that were sick: that it might be fulfilled
which was spoken by Esaias the prophet, saying, Himself
took our infirmities, and bare our sicknesses.”</span>
Mat. 8:16, 17. God manifested in the flesh is a perfect
Redeemer, the conqueror of sin, sickness and
death, the destroyer of Satan's works, and the light
of the world.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
That the Holy Spirit is a personage many question.
But the doubts and denials of a nation, or of a world,
do not change the Word of God. He is the third
person in the trinity without controversy. The Holy
Spirit is not a mere emanation or influence, but a person
or being, capable of works, or the performance of
a mission. As a person he guides: <span class="tei tei-q">“Howbeit when
he, the Spirit of truth is come, he will guide you
into all truth.”</span> John 16:13. He as a person teaches:
<span class="tei tei-q">“But the Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, whom
the Father will send in my name, he shall teach
you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance,
whatsoever I have said unto you.”</span> John 14:26.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This teacher and guide is not a mere influence, such
as love. The Scriptures in speaking of the Holy Spirit
use the personal pronoun. The Holy Spirit as the
third person in the trinity is the special gift of God
unto his children: <span class="tei tei-q">“And, behold, I send the promise
of my Father upon you.”</span> Luke 24:49. God gave this
promise by the mouth of his prophet Joel, <span class="tei tei-q">“And it
shall come to pass afterward, that I will pour out my
Spirit upon all flesh.”</span> Joel 2:28. This promise was
the gift of the Holy Spirit. See Acts 2:17, 18, 38.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Upon whom this gift is bestowed is a subject of
more controversy perhaps than any other Bible theme.
There need be no confusion upon this point if all
would take the plain statements and examples in the
New Testament. Jesus declares the world can not receive
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page316">[pg 316]</span><a name="Pg316" id="Pg316" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the Spirit, John 14:17. The disciples enjoyed
the experience of regeneration all through the Lord's
ministry. Some will take issue with us here, but we
have the whole of the Word on our side, or rather we
are on the side of the Word of God. They preached,
they east out devils, they healed the sick, they rejoiced,
they prayed, the Lord administered unto them the
newly instituted ordinance of the Lord's Supper, and
originated the precious ordinance of feet-washing.
He told them their names were written in heaven. He
said he had chosen them out of the world, and that
they were not of the world, even as he was not of the
world. He prayed God to keep them from the evils
of the world, and said that the glory the Father
gave him he had given them, and that he had kept
them in his Father's name, and none of them was lost.
What more proof do you require to convince you that
they were not sinners? Some who endeavor to overthrow
the doctrine of receiving the Holy Spirit as the
sanctifier subsequent to regeneration, say that <span class="tei tei-q">“the
justification of the disciples was an Old Testament justification,
and not a justification under the gospel, and
Pentecost was the receiving of the New Testament
justification.”</span> Did you ever hear of a justification
under the law spoken of as the experience of the disciples
was spoken of by the Savior? They were not
like the other Jews that kept the law. They were
separated from them and persecuted by them. Jesus
said, <span class="tei tei-q">“Ye have followed me in the regeneration.”</span>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page317">[pg 317]</span><a name="Pg317" id="Pg317" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Mat. 19:28. It was not a justification under the law,
but a regeneration in Christ.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In John, seventeenth chapter, after telling the Father
that he had chosen them out of the world and
kept them in his name, that none of them should be
lost, he then prays for their sanctification. After
saying in the sixteenth verse, <span class="tei tei-q">“They are not of the
world, even as I am not of the world,”</span> in the next
verse he prays the Father to sanctify them. In Mat.
9:2, Jesus says to the man sick of the palsy, <span class="tei tei-q">“Son, be
of good cheer, thy sins be forgiven thee.”</span> Was not
this a gospel justification or pardon? There was no
offering of the blood of animals to secure a justification
by the law. This is to prove that Christ did give
his followers the experience of the <span class="tei tei-q">“new birth”</span> before
his crucifixion. I do not doubt that this man was
present and received the Holy Spirit at Pentecost.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Another clear example set before us of the Christians
in the morning of this gospel day receiving the
Holy Spirit as the third person in the trinity after
regeneration, is that of the brethren at Samaria, recorded
in Acts, eighth chapter. Philip went down
thither and preached Christ unto them, and they gave
heed to the things he spake, ver. 5, 6. Do you not
think this was a New Testament justification? The
seventh verse says that unclean spirits were cast out
and the palsied and lame were healed. Do you suppose
that all this was done unto sinners? The fourteenth
verse says they <span class="tei tei-q">“received the word.”</span> James
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page318">[pg 318]</span><a name="Pg318" id="Pg318" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
says, <span class="tei tei-q">“Receive with meekness the engrafted word,
which is able to save your souls.”</span> Jas. 1:21. The
sixteenth verse of the eighth chapter of Acts says they
were baptized in the name of Jesus. The seventeenth
verse speaks of their reception of the Holy Spirit.
Some are at this point ready to say that Simon believed
Philip's preaching and was baptized, and yet
not saved. This is very true. He was a hypocrite.
The remainder were not, you know full well. Because
they were sincere they received an experience, and
were made fit subjects to receive the Holy Spirit. Because
he was not saved he could not receive him.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
A similar instance of the outpouring of the Holy
Spirit upon the previously regenerated is that of
Cornelius, recorded in the tenth chapter of Acts. We
are often told that Cornelius was a devout man under
the law like Moses, Isaiah, and other Old Testament
prophets. This is only a supposition, and one without
foundation. Cornelius was not a keeper of the law.
He was a Gentile, a Roman centurion. He had heard
of Jesus, ver. 36, 37. He had learned enough to believe
on him for the salvation from sin, but wanted
to be taught the way of God more perfectly. Under
Peter's preaching they received the Holy Spirit. In
the nineteenth chapter of Acts is preserved the experience
of twelve men at Ephesus. They were disciples.
The Jews under the law were never called disciples.
A disciple is a follower or learner of Christ.
Paul preached to them and laid hands upon them, and
they received the Holy Ghost.
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page319">[pg 319]</span><a name="Pg319" id="Pg319" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This is the dispensation of the Holy Spirit. As holy
men were once led and spoken to by God directly,
holy men are now led and spoken to by the Holy
Spirit. The man who rejects the power, work and
light of the Holy Spirit is like a blind man who does
not believe the existence of a sun because he never
saw the light. The Holy Spirit calls to the ministry.
Acts 13:1-4. He leads them and directs them where
to preach or labor. Acts 8:26, 29; 16:6, 7. He created
the overseers. Acts 20:28. Men spake as moved by the
Holy Spirit. They spake as the Spirit gave them
utterance. God sets all the members in the body as
pleases him. 1 Cor. 12:18. He does this through
the agency of the Holy Spirit. 1 Cor. 12:13. Apostles
and prophets and teachers and gifts of healing
and miracles and tongues are all the gifts of the
Holy Spirit. The whole work of God is now carried
on by the Holy Spirit, the third person in the trinity.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The Scriptural right for women to labor in the gospel
as exhorters, teachers, preachers, etc., is questioned
by many. To deny women such a privilege is
contrary to the Christian spirit of equality, and a serious
obstruction to pure gospel light. We (male and
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page320">[pg 320]</span><a name="Pg320" id="Pg320" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
female) are all one in Christ Jesus. Gal. 3:28. In
the kingdom of grace man and woman are on an equal
footing so far as concerns the work of God. To explain
some texts that seem to prohibit women from
laboring in the gospel and to prove positively to you
that women did so labor in the morning light of the
church, we will transcribe an article written by Bro.
Geo. Cole, and which appeared in the Gospel Trumpet.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“I commend unto you Phebe our sister, which is a
servant of the church which is at Cenchrea.”</span> The
church at Cenchrea was a local congregation or assembly.
Phebe our sister—that this personage was a woman,
no one disputes, and she was a servant of the
church. Servant-<span lang="el" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="el"><span style="font-style: italic">diakonos</span></span>, translated servant
in the following texts: Mat. 23:11; Mark 9:35; John 12:26;
Rom. 16:1. Translated deacon in Phil. 1:1; 1
Tim. 3:8, 12. Translated minister: Mat. 20:26, 28;
Mark 10:43, 45; Rom. 15:8; 1 Cor. 3:5; 2 Cor. 3:6;
6:4; 11:15, 23; Eph. 3:7; 6:21; Col. 1:7, 23, 25;
4:7; 1 Thes. 3:2; 1 Tim. 4:6; Rom. 12:7; 2 Cor. 8:4;
Mat. 25:44; 2 Cor. 3:3; Heb. 6:10; 1:14; 1 Pet.
1:12; 4:10, 11.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The extensive use of this word <span lang="el" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="el"><span style="font-style: italic">diakonos</span></span> in
the New Testament readily determines its meaning. That Paul
conferred upon Phebe the church title
<span class="tei tei-q">“<span lang="el" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="el"><span style="font-style: italic">diakonos</span></span>”</span> is
unquestionable, and as such it means minister or deacon.
Liddell and Scott's lexicon comments on
<span lang="el" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="el"><span style="font-style: italic">diakonos</span></span>
as used in the New Testament as follows: A servant,
waiting man or woman, minister, a messenger, a minister
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page321">[pg 321]</span><a name="Pg321" id="Pg321" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of the church. Any one can see the above definition
covers all the ground of elder. I will offer a few
proof texts. <span class="tei tei-q">“He that is greatest among you, shall be
your servant [<span lang="el" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="el"><span style="font-style: italic">diakonos</span></span>].”</span> Mat. 23:11.
<span class="tei tei-q">“Whosoever will be great among you, let him be your minister
[<span lang="el" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="el"><span style="font-style: italic">diakonos</span></span>].”</span> Mat. 20:26. <span class="tei tei-q">“Ministers
[<span lang="el" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="el"><span style="font-style: italic">diakonos]</span></span>
by whom ye believed.”</span> 1 Cor. 3:5. <span class="tei tei-q">“Who also hath made us able
ministers [<span lang="el" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="el"><span style="font-style: italic">diakonos</span></span>] of the New
Testament.”</span> 2 Cor. 3:6. <span class="tei tei-q">“Thou shalt be a good minister
[<span lang="el" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="el"><span style="font-style: italic">diakonos</span></span>] of Jesus Christ.”</span> 1 Tim. 4:6.
<span class="tei tei-q">“In all things approving ourselves as the ministers
[<span lang="el" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="el"><span style="font-style: italic">diakonos</span></span>]
of God.”</span> 2 Cor. 6:4. <span class="tei tei-q">“Whereof I was made a
minister [<span lang="el" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="el"><span style="font-style: italic">diakonos</span></span>].”</span> Eph. 3:7.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Thus we might swell the testimony that <span lang="el" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="el"><span style="font-style: italic">diakonos</span></span>
was the common term used in the New Testament
signifying the ministerial office of minister, elder,
preacher, etc. Therefore the evidences are in Phebe's
favor that she was a minister or elder rather than
a deaconess. If we consider Paul's commendation of
her standing and the sending of his Roman epistle by
her, as having some weight, this certainly favors the
above conclusion.

<h4 class="tei tei-head" style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 2.00em; margin-top: 2.00em">Prophecy.</h4>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span lang="el" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="el"><span style="font-style: italic">Propheteuo</span></span>—to prophesy publicly, to
expound, to preach, etc. There were certain prophets and teachers
in the church at Antioch, as Barnabas, Simeon,
Lucius, Manaen, and Saul or Paul. Acts 13:1. They
were public expounders of the Scriptures. Prophesy—to
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page322">[pg 322]</span><a name="Pg322" id="Pg322" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
speak, to edify, exhort, and comfort. 1 Cor. 14:3.
A few examples: Zacharias filled with the
Holy Ghost prophesied. Luke 1:67-79. Compare this
prophecy with Mary's words in Luke 1:46-55.
<span class="tei tei-q">“They spake with tongues and prophesied.”</span> Acts 19:6.
<span class="tei tei-q">“And Judas and Silas, being prophets also themselves,
exhorted the brethren with many words, and
confirmed them.”</span> Acts 15:32. <span class="tei tei-q">“Mystery of Christ
which in other ages was not made known unto the sons
of men, as it is now revealed unto his holy apostles
and prophets by the Spirit.”</span> Eph. 3:4, 5. Prophets
were set in the church. <span class="tei tei-q">“He gave some, apostles;
and some, prophets.”</span> Eph. 4:11. <span class="tei tei-q">“And God set
some in the church, first apostles, secondarily prophets.”</span>
1 Cor. 12:28. And there were certain prophets
and teachers in the church which was at Antioch.
Acts 13:1.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Thus we see the prophets were identical with or
a constituent part of the New Testament ministry;
and it only remains for us to prove there were women
prophets in the church and we have women identified
with the ministry. Example: Philip the evangelist,
which was one of the seven. <span class="tei tei-q">“And the same man
had four daughters, virgins, which did prophesy.”</span>
Acts 21:8, 9. <span class="tei tei-q">“But every woman that prayeth or
prophesieth with her head uncovered dishonoreth
her head: for that is even all one as if she were
shaven.”</span> 1 Cor. 11: 5. If there were no women
prophets it were foolish to give directions for them
while praying or prophesying.
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page323">[pg 323]</span><a name="Pg323" id="Pg323" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Joel prophesied, <span class="tei tei-q">“And it shall come to pass in
the last days, saith God, I will pour out of my Spirit
upon all flesh: and your sons and your daughters
shall prophesy, and your young men shall see visions,
and your old men shall dream dreams: and on my
servants and on my handmaidens I will pour out in
those days of my Spirit; and they shall prophesy.”</span>
Acts 2:17, 18. We observe first, men and women
were placed on equality as prophets: second, this was
to be a characteristic feature or mark of the last days,
or last dispensation; third, this was being fulfilled at
that time, at Pentecost, as women were present. Acts 1:14.
All were filled with the Holy Ghost, and spoke
with tongues as the Spirit gave them utterance. Acts 2:1-4.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Paul speaks of the whole church coming together
into one place. 1 Cor. 14:23. This includes both men
and women. He says, <span class="tei tei-q">“But if all [men and women]
prophesy, and there come in one that believeth not,
or one unlearned, he is convinced of all, he is judged
of all,”</span> ver. 24. In verse 31 he says, <span class="tei tei-q">“For ye may
all prophesy one by one, that all may learn, and all
may be comforted.”</span> This was an extended privilege
to all, though not expected of all, as we see in 1 Cor. 12:29:
<span class="tei tei-q">“Are all prophets?”</span> Paul expressly mentions
those women which labored with him in the gospel.
Phil. 4:3. See Rom. 16:1, 3, 7, 12. <span class="tei tei-q">“Labored
in the gospel.”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“Elders ... labor in the word and doctrine.”</span>
1 Tim. 5:17. This was exactly the kind of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page324">[pg 324]</span><a name="Pg324" id="Pg324" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
work that Paul was doing, and those women labored
with him in the gospel. <span class="tei tei-q">“In the gospel”</span> signifies
here, evangelizing, spreading or preaching the gospel,
etc. Let us not confound ordinary testimony with
prophesying. A person must have the gift of prophecy
in order to prophesy: and it is this gift that constitutes
a person a prophet. Proof texts, Rom. 12:6;
1 Cor. 12:10, 28; 14:1, 3, 6, 12, 29, 39; Eph. 4:8-11.
And we have before proved that women did possess
this gift, hence were prophetesses or public expounders
of the gospel, and hence they have a constituent
part in the ministry, and as such are just as much
elders in the church of God as men.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Let your women keep silence in the churches.”</span>
1 Cor. 14:39. <span class="tei tei-q">“Let him keep silence in the church.”</span>
Ver. 28. If these scriptures had no contexts to explain
them we would all be silenced in the church.
The context to the last quotation reads thus. <span class="tei tei-q">“But
if there be no interpreter, let him keep silence.”</span>
This makes it clear. Context to the first reads, <span class="tei tei-q">“For
it is not permitted unto them to speak: but they are
commanded to be under obedience, as also saith the
law. And if they will learn anything, let them ask
their husbands at home.”</span> What kind of speech is
forbidden? Ans.—Asking questions in the church
to learn, interrogative speech in the public congregation.
The law did not prohibit women being prophets
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page325">[pg 325]</span><a name="Pg325" id="Pg325" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
or prophesying. See Deborah, in Judges 4:4-14.
Miriam, Ex. 15:20. Anna, Luke 2:36. If the law
did not prohibit women prophesying, Paul did not
call in question the obedience of the law to prove
that point. Thus the context explains itself without
further comment. Does not the character of Jezebel
<span class="tei tei-q">“which calleth herself a prophetess”</span> disapprove of
women prophets? Rev. 2:20. No! no more than
Satan's ministers transforming themselves into the
ministers of Christ would disapprove of the entire
Christian ministry. The counterfeit proves there is
a genuine. This is conclusive proof in itself that
there were true prophetesses in the church in those
days.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Teach nor to usurp authority over the man”</span> (1
Tim. 2:12), is offered in argument against women
prophets. Such argument betrays ignorance in the nature
and spirit of prophecy. A woman filled with the
Holy Spirit, prophesying, speaking unto men to edification,
exhorting, and comforting, is not usurping
authority over any one.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
There is recorded in the Old Testament the account
of God giving a law to govern his people Israel.
This is called a covenant, and was to serve as a schoolmaster
to lead its subjects to Christ. This law was a
shadow of good things to come; that is, it contained
types and shadows of something real in the blessed
day of gospel grace. The blood of the animals that
was shed could not take away sins, but is typical of
the blood of Jesus, who in the end of the world appeared
to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself.
There is no power in the blood of animals to redeem
man from sin, but we are redeemed with the precious
blood of Christ, as of a lamb without blemish and
without spot. The unblemished lamb offered in sacrifice
under the Jewish economy was typical or a shadow of
the spotless Christ, slain for the sins of the world.
The types and shadows of the law all center in Christ.
When he the substance is come the shadow of necessity
vanishes away. When the shadow meets the substance
the shadow has an end. The redemption which
we have in Jesus not only redeems us from sin, but
also from the bondage of the Sinaitic law. <span class="tei tei-q">“But
when the fulness of the time was come, God sent
forth his Son, made of a woman, made under the
law, to redeem them that were under the law, that
we might receive the adoption of sons.”</span> Gal. 4:4, 5.
<span class="tei tei-q">“Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law,
being made a curse for us.”</span> Gal. 3:13.
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page331">[pg 331]</span><a name="Pg331" id="Pg331" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
There is no salvation to be obtained by the observance
of any part or the whole of the law of Moses including
the ten commandments. Salvation or redemption
is only found in Christ and the gospel.
<span class="tei tei-q">“Neither by the blood of goats and calves, but by
his own blood he entered in once into the holy place,
having obtained eternal redemption for us.”</span> Heb.
9:12. <span class="tei tei-q">“For what the law could not do, in that it
was weak through the flesh, God sending his own Son
in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin, condemned
sin in the flesh.”</span> Rom. 8:3. It is not through the
law we obtain salvation, but through the gospel.
<span class="tei tei-q">“For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ: for
it is the power of God unto salvation to every one
that believeth; to the Jew first, and also to the Greek.”</span>
Rom. 1:16. <span class="tei tei-q">“Wherefore lay apart all filthiness and
superfluity of naughtiness, and receive with meekness
the engrafted word, which is able to save your souls.”</span>
Jas. 1:21. <span class="tei tei-q">“Being born again, not of corruptible
seed, but of incorruptible, by the word of God,
which liveth and abideth forever.”</span> 1 Pet. 1:23.
In Rom. 1:16, Gal. 3:26, Rev. 5:9, and many other
texts, we learn that all are accepted by God unto salvation
through Christ. This necessitates an end of
the law, since the law is given to the Jew only. There
is no shift or revision made of the law in Christ to
include both Jew and Gentile; it is simply done, and
the gospel succeeds.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The apostles very clearly and decidedly teach an
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page332">[pg 332]</span><a name="Pg332" id="Pg332" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
abolition of the ancient faulty Sinaitic law. Paul says,
<span class="tei tei-q">“Having abolished [destroyed—Webster] in his flesh
the enmity, even the law of commandments contained
in ordinances; for to make in himself of twain
one new man so making peace.”</span> Eph. 2:15. The enmity
here spoken of is the enmity or separation made
between the Jew and Gentile by the Mosaic law. This
law of the Jews stood as a partition wall between the
Israelite and the Gentile world. In Jesus this wall was
torn down, and the Gentile as well as the Jew was offered
salvation. In verse fourteen Paul says, <span class="tei tei-q">“For he
is our peace, who hath made both one [Jew and Gentile],
and hath broken down the middle wall of partition
between us.”</span> The Jewish ordinances and laws
that stood as a mighty wall between the Gentile and
the Jew were broken down and all the world of every
kindred, nation and tongue was given equal rights
under an entirely new order of things.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The coming of Christ was the fulfilling of the law.
The law was only given to serve until Jesus came.
When he came its object or purpose was fulfilled and
had an end. <span class="tei tei-q">“But before faith came, we were kept
under the law, shut up unto the faith which should
afterwards be revealed. Wherefore the law was our
schoolmaster to bring us unto Christ, that we might
be justified by faith. But after that faith is come,
we are no longer under a schoolmaster.”</span> Gal. 3:23-25.
This is plain, positive language. After faith
or Christ has come we are no longer under a schoolmaster,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page333">[pg 333]</span><a name="Pg333" id="Pg333" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
which is the law. This accords with Rom.
6:14: <span class="tei tei-q">“For sin shall not have dominion over you: for
ye are not under the law, but under grace.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
As we have before mentioned, the law did not deliver
us from the power of sin; but after grace came
by Jesus Christ we are not under the law, but under
grace, and where sin once abounded, that is, had
power or dominion, grace now much more abounds;
therefore sin has no dominion over us. In Rom. 7:4
the apostle tells us we have become dead to the law
by the body of Christ.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In the seventh verse, still speaking of this law, to
which we become dead by the body of Christ, he
quotes one of the ten commandments, thereby teaching
us that by the body of Christ we are no longer
under the ten-commandment law. The ten-commandment
law simply as the ten-commandment law is no
more in force and effect than if it were never given.
Some of the principles embodied in the ten commandments
are embodied in the New Testament. These
are in effect, not because they are principles of the
ten commandments, but because they are principles of
the New Testament. Must I as a Christian refrain
from committing adultery because it is forbidden by
one of the ten commandments? We answer, No. But
as a Christian in this dispensation of the gospel I
must refrain from such acts because it is forbidden
in the New Testament. We must live in the spirit of
the gospel. We could live without violation of this
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page334">[pg 334]</span><a name="Pg334" id="Pg334" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
seventh commandment, and yet commit adultery according
to the New Testament and be wholly destitute
of the grace of God. Jesus says that <span class="tei tei-q">“whosoever
looketh on a woman to lust after her hath committed
adultery with her already in his heart.”</span> Mat.
5:28. The salvation of the gospel removes such unholy
desires from the heart.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Tell me, ye that desire to be under the law, do
ye not hear the law? For it is written, that Abraham
had two sons, the one by a bondmaid, the other
by a freewoman. But he who was of the bondmaid
was born after the flesh; but he of the freewoman
was by promise. Which things are an allegory: for
these are the two covenants; the one from mount
Sinai, which gendereth to bondage, which is Agar.
For this Agar is mount Sinai in Arabia, and answereth
to Jerusalem which now is, and is in bondage
with her children. But Jerusalem which is above is
free, which is the mother of us all.”</span> Gal. 4:21-26.
Here the apostle uses the two sons of Abraham allegorically.
They represent the two covenants or testaments.
See margin. The one by the bondmaid
he uses to represent the testament or covenant given
from Sinai. The one by the free woman, the covenant
given by Christ, or the New Testament.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The apostle goes further and tells us what disposition
to make of the two sons or testaments. <span class="tei tei-q">“Nevertheless
what saith the scripture? Cast out the bondwoman
and her son: for the son of the bondwoman
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page335">[pg 335]</span><a name="Pg335" id="Pg335" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
shall not be heir with the son of the freewoman. So
then, brethren, we are not children of the bondwoman,
but of the free.”</span> Gal. 4:30, 31. The mission of the
Sinaitic law is completed. It has finished its course.
We are in the glorious freedom of the New Testament.
Paul adds in the next chapter, <span class="tei tei-q">“Stand fast therefore,
in the liberty wherewith Christ hath made us free,
and be not entangled again with the yoke of bondage.”</span>
Ver. 1.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
He speaks further of the two covenants in the
eighth chapter of Hebrews, and says, <span class="tei tei-q">“For if that
first covenant had been faultless, then should no place
have been sought for the second. For finding fault
with them, he saith, Behold, the days come, saith
the Lord, when I will make a new covenant with the
house of Israel and with the house of Judah: not
according to the covenant that I made with their
fathers in the day when I took them by the hand to
lead them out of the land of Egypt; because they
continued not in my covenant, and I regarded them
not, saith the Lord.”</span> What was the covenant that
God made with Israel when he led them out of the
land of Egypt? It was the entire law given at Sinai,
including the ten commandments. Whoever would
here make a division in the covenant, and say only the
ceremonial law is included in the covenant mentioned
in these texts simply makes the assertion to sustain
some adopted views of his creed. There is no foundation
here for any division. This first, covenant is the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page336">[pg 336]</span><a name="Pg336" id="Pg336" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
whole covenant, and it was faulty. In verse thirteen
he says it waxeth old and is ready to vanish away.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Continuing in the ninth chapter the apostle speaks
of the ordinances of the first covenant, which stood
in meals and drinks and divers washings. Ver. 10.
These ordinances of the first covenant were imposed
upon them until the time of reformation. We are
to understand by this that at the bringing in of the
reformation they <span class="tei tei-q">“vanished away.”</span> In the Colossian
letter he mentions those ordinances together with
some others as being blotted out at Calvary. We
will quote his words: <span class="tei tei-q">“Blotting out the handwriting
of ordinances that was against us, which was
contrary to us, and took it out of the way, nailing it
to his cross.”</span> Col. 2:14. In the sixteenth verse he
tells us what ordinances were blotted out: <span class="tei tei-q">“Let no
man therefore [since they are nailed to the cross]
judge you in meat or in drink, or in respect of a holy
day, or of the new moon, or of the sabbath days.”</span>
The Jew was denied by the law the privilege of eating
certain kinds of meat. Such restrictions were nailed
to the cross, and since Calvary nothing is <span class="tei tei-q">“common
or unclean.”</span> Their holy days and solemn assemblies
at certain stages of the moon find no place in the
New Testament. The keeping of the Sabbath as
commanded on the tables of stone was also nailed to
the cross, therefore let no man judge us or bind these
things upon us.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The Sabbath of the ten commandments had its
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page337">[pg 337]</span><a name="Pg337" id="Pg337" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
mission. It was a shadow of good things to come.
It was typical of the rest which is found in Jesus.
Of all the types and shadows of the Sinaitic covenant,
none is more beautiful than the keeping of the Sabbath.
It foreshadows the rest or peacefulness of
Christ's kingdom. Jesus says, <span class="tei tei-q">“Come unto me, all
ye that labor and are heavy-laden, and I will give you
rest. Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for
I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest
unto your souls.”</span> Mat. 11:28, 29. The Old Testament
prophets beheld the rest that was to be obtained
in Jesus: <span class="tei tei-q">“And in that day there shall be a root of
Jesse, which shall stand for an ensign of the people;
to it shall the Gentiles seek: and his rest shall be
glorious.”</span> Isa. 11:10.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
That the seventh-day Sabbath kept by the Jews is
the Christian day of worship is a heretical doctrine,
being taught at the present day. To make clear to your
understanding that the Sabbath of the ten-commandment
law is not the Christian day of worship is our
object in showing you it was only a type. If it was a
type then certainly when we have reached the antitype
the type has an end. Since the Word of God
is so plain we feel confident we can make it clear
and comprehensive to you. We will first quote from
Heb. 4:4-11: <span class="tei tei-q">“For he spake in a certain place of
the seventh day on this wise, And God did rest the
seventh day from all his works.”</span> (See Gen. 2:1-3.)
<span class="tei tei-q">“And in this place again. If they shall enter into my
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page338">[pg 338]</span><a name="Pg338" id="Pg338" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
rest.”</span> See third verse. <span class="tei tei-q">“Seeing therefore it remaineth
that some must enter therein, and they to whom
it was first preached entered not in because of unbelief:
again, he limiteth a certain day, saying in
David, To-day, after so long a time, as it is said,
To-day if ye will hear his voice, harden not your
hearts. For if Jesus had given them rest, then would
he not afterward have spoken of another day. There
remaineth therefore a rest to the people of God. For
he that is entered into his rest, he also hath ceased
from his own works, as God did from his. Let us
labor therefore to enter into that rest, lest any man
fall after the same example of unbelief.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
We now wish to briefly review this quotation. In
the fourth verse it is said that God rested on the seventh
day from all his works. This is recorded in Gen.
2:1-3. This is the <span class="tei tei-q">“place”</span> that the seventh-day rest
is spoken of. But this day of rest is only a shadow of
another day of rest. He speaks of another day. See
seventh and eighth verses of quotation; also Psa. 95:7,
8. <span class="tei tei-q">“To-day if ye will hear his voice, harden not your
heart.”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“For if Jesus had given them rest,”</span> Rotherham
says, <span class="tei tei-q">“For if unto them Joshua had given rest.”</span>
See also margin of common version. Joshua led the
children of Israel across the Jordan into the land of
Canaan. This land is also typical of a restful state
in the kingdom of grace. Had Joshua given them
rest he would not have spoken of another day of rest.
But they did not enter into his rest, therefore there
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page339">[pg 339]</span><a name="Pg339" id="Pg339" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
remaineth another day of rest to the people of God.
What day is it? It is the gospel day. The marginal
rendering of the word <span class="tei tei-q">“rest”</span> is the <span class="tei tei-q">“keeping of a
Sabbath.”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“Hence there is being left over a sabbath
keeping for the people of God.”</span>—Rotherham. Like
as God did cease from his own works and rest on the
Sabbath, and as the Jews kept it strictly as a day of
rest, so we in Jesus find rest and have ceased from our
own works. It was all works under the law, but we
have ceased from such works in Jesus. Therefore the
Jewish Sabbath day of rest only typifies the blessed
rest of the day of salvation by grace, and not by works.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Under the New Testament we keep as one of the early
church fathers has said, <span class="tei tei-q">“The day on which our
Lord arose.”</span> The writings of church history frequently
make mention of Sunday (the first day of the
week) as being the Christian's day of worship in
commemoration of the resurrection of our Lord, in
whom we are a new creation. The weekly meeting together
of the Christians as recorded in the New Testament
was always on the first day of the week. See
Luke 24:33; John 20:19, 26; 1 Cor. 16:2; Acts 20:6, 7.
There is not one text in the New Testament recording
a Christian meeting on the seventh day. Here
are four texts recording meetings held on the first
day. The Sabbath, as well as the whole of the ten-commandment
and ceremonial law finds an end when
we have come to <span class="tei tei-q">“another day”</span>—the day of salvation,
wherein we are a new creation. 2 Cor. 5:17.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
We will close this subject by quoting 2 Cor. 3, beginning
at verse five: <span class="tei tei-q">“Not that we are sufficient of
ourselves to think anything as of ourselves; but our
sufficiency is of God; who also hath made us able
ministers of the New Testament; not of the letter, but
of the Spirit: for the letter killeth, but the Spirit giveth
life. But if the ministration of death, written
and engraven in stones, was glorious, so that the children
of Israel could not steadfastly behold the face
of Moses for the glory of his countenance; which glory
is to be done away: how shall not the ministration
of the Spirit be rather glorious? For if the ministration
of condemnation be glory, much more doth the
ministration of righteousness exceed in glory. For
even that which was made glorious had no glory in
this respect, by reason of the glory that excelleth.
For if that which is done away is glorious, much more
that which remaineth is glorious. Seeing then that
we have such hope, we use great plainness of speech:
and not as Moses, which put a vail over his face, that
the children of Israel could not steadfastly look to
the end of that which is abolished: but their minds
were blinded: for until this day remaineth the same
vail untaken away in the reading of the Old Testament;
which vail is done away in Christ. But even
unto this day, when Moses is read, the vail is upon
their heart. Nevertheless when it shall turn to the
Lord, the vail shall be taken away.”</span>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It is with reluctance that we refrain from comment
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page341">[pg 341]</span><a name="Pg341" id="Pg341" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
on the above, however we believe the abolition of the
whole Mosaic system to be so plain to every unprejudiced
heart as to render comment unnecessary.

<h3 class="tei tei-head" style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 2.40em; margin-top: 2.40em"><span style="font-size: 120%">Good Works.</span></h3>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Christians possess a light; they are <span class="tei tei-q">“children of
light,”</span> and are commanded to <span class="tei tei-q">“let their light shine.”</span>
How can Christians shine the light of the gospel and
of God? By their good works. Jesus says, <span class="tei tei-q">“Let
your light so shine before men, that they may see
your good works, and glorify your Father which is in
heaven.”</span> Mat. 5:16. God has ordained that in Christ
we should perform good works. <span class="tei tei-q">“For we are his
workmanship, created in Christ Jesus unto good
works, which God hath before ordained that we should
walk in them.”</span> Eph. 2:10. By the apostle Christians
are exhorted to be careful to maintain good
works. <span class="tei tei-q">“This is a faithful saying, and these things
I will that thou affirm constantly, that they which
have believed in God might be careful to maintain
good works.”</span> Titus 3:8. Then adds, <span class="tei tei-q">“These things
are good and profitable unto men.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
We have proven by the Word elsewhere that salvation
from sin is not attained by good works alone,
but after we are saved by grace we retain the grace
by a strict and faithful performance of all Christian
duties. The first neglect to perform a known duty
is the first step the Christian takes on his return to the
<span class="tei tei-q">“beggarly elements of the world.”</span> We are commanded
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page342">[pg 342]</span><a name="Pg342" id="Pg342" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
to <span class="tei tei-q">“search the scriptures.”</span> By looking into this
perfect <span class="tei tei-q">“law of liberty,”</span> and conforming our lives
to the glorious truth taught there, we will be led into
the beautiful walk of Christian virtue and duty.
<span class="tei tei-q">“All scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is
profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction,
for instruction in righteousness that the man of God
may be perfect, thoroughly furnished unto all good
works.”</span> When a house is <span class="tei tei-q">“thoroughly furnished”</span>
we understand it is furnished in every room up-stairs
and down. The Scriptures are given us that by
searching them and receiving of their corrections,
reprovings, and instructions we may be furnished in
every department of our capabilities with good works.
If man obeys the voice of the inspired Word of God
he will be <span class="tei tei-q">“a vessel unto honor, sanctified and meet
for the Master's use, and prepared unto every good
work.”</span> Christians should be rich in good works.
<span class="tei tei-q">“That they do good, that they be rich in good works,
ready to distribute, willing to communicate.”</span> 1 Tim. 6:18.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Saints should be fruitful in good works. <span class="tei tei-q">“That
ye might walk worthy of the Lord unto all pleasing,
being fruitful in every good work, and increasing in
the knowledge of God.”</span> Saved people in some texts
of Scripture are likened unto good trees. They are
a tree that is abounding with the fruit of every good
work. Christians are admonished to be ready to every
good work. <span class="tei tei-q">“Put them in mind to be subject to principalities
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page343">[pg 343]</span><a name="Pg343" id="Pg343" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
and powers, to obey magistrates, to be ready to
every good work.”</span> Titus 3:1. They should be established
in them. <span class="tei tei-q">“Now our Lord Jesus Christ himself,
and God, even our Father, which hath loved us, and
hath given us everlasting consolation and good hope
through grace, comfort your hearts and stablish you
in every good word and work.”</span> 2 Thes. 2:16, 17.
They should abound to all good works. <span class="tei tei-q">“And God
is able to make all grace abound toward you; that
ye, always having all sufficiency in all things, may
abound to every good work.”</span> 2 Cor. 9:8.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The apostle prayed that they should be made
perfect in every good work. <span class="tei tei-q">“Now the God of peace,
that brought again from the dead our Lord Jesus,
that great Shepherd of the sheep, through the blood
of the everlasting covenant, make you perfect in
every good work to do his will, working in you that
which is well-pleasing in his sight, through Jesus
Christ: to whom be glory forever and ever. Amen.”</span>
Heb. 13:20, 21. This is a most precious text. <span class="tei tei-q">“Working
in you”</span> in the margin is rendered <span class="tei tei-q">“doing.”</span> All
the good things a Christian does is not him doing it,
but it is God doing it in him, so he is not found going
about telling what he has done.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Saints should provoke each other to good works.
<span class="tei tei-q">“And let us consider one another to provoke unto love
and to good works.”</span> Heb. 10:24. We know of no
better way to provoke others to good works than
by setting a good example before them. All their
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page344">[pg 344]</span><a name="Pg344" id="Pg344" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
good works should be done in wisdom and meekness
or humility. <span class="tei tei-q">“Who is a wise man and endued
with knowledge among you? let him shew out
of a good conversation [or conduct] his works with
meekness of wisdom.”</span> Jas. 3:13.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The people of God do not adorn themselves with
gold and pearls and costly array to appear beautiful,
<span class="tei tei-q">“but with good works.”</span> 1 Tim. 2:9, 10. What can be
more lovely than a character beautified by the
ornaments of every good work in the meekness of
wisdom? Glory to the name of Jesus! My soul feels
like crying. <span class="tei tei-q">“Lord, work more of thy good works in
the hearts of thy people.”</span> Man's works shall be
brought into judgment. <span class="tei tei-q">“For we must all appear before
the judgment-seat of Christ; that every one may
receive the things done in his body, according to that
he hath done, whether it be good or bad.”</span> 2 Cor. 5:10.
<span class="tei tei-q">“For God shall bring every work into judgment,
with every secret thing, whether it be good, or whether
it be evil.”</span> Eccl. 12:14.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
That will be an awful hour when we are called before
the tribunal of God and there have to unfold to
the incomprehensible One our true character. Oh,
what will it be worth in that day to hear him say,
<span class="tei tei-q">“Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom
prepared for you from the foundation of the world:
for I was an hungered, and ye gave me meat: I was
thirsty, and ye gave me drink: I was a stranger,
and ye took me in: naked, and ye clothed me: I was
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page345">[pg 345]</span><a name="Pg345" id="Pg345" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
sick, and ye visited me: I was in prison, and ye
came unto me.”</span> Mat. 25:34-36.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The cheerful giving of our worldly goods to help
the needy or for the furtherance of the cause of
Christ is a work very commendable in the sight of
the Lord. <span class="tei tei-q">“But this I say, He which soweth sparingly
shall reap also sparingly, and he which soweth
bountifully shall reap also bountifully. Every
man according as he purposeth in his heart, so let
him give, not grudgingly, or of necessity: for God
loveth a cheerful giver. And God is able to make all
grace abound toward you; that ye, having all sufficiency
in all things, may abound to every good work:
as it is written, He hath dispersed abroad; he hath
given to the poor: his righteousness remaineth forever.”</span>
2 Cor. 9:6-9.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
To quote from the writings of a Christian friend
will be sufficient on this subject, we think, to enable
the reader to see the beauty and blessings in giving
unto the needy and the cause of Christ as unto the
Lord.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“We find both in prophecy and in the New Testament
much about giving. In Amos, chapter four,
we read, <span class="tei tei-q">‘Hear this word, ye kine of Bashan, that
are in the mountain of Samaria, which oppress the
poor, which crush the needy, which say to their masters,
Bring, and let us drink. The Lord God hath
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page346">[pg 346]</span><a name="Pg346" id="Pg346" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
sworn by his holiness.... I also have given you
cleanness of teeth in all your cities, and want of
bread in all your places: ... also I have withholden
the rain from you, when there were yet three months
to the harvest.... I have smitten you with blasting
and mildew: when your gardens and your vineyards
and your fig-trees and your olive-trees increased, the
palmer worm devoured them.... I have sent among
you the pestilence, ... yet have ye not returned unto
me, saith the Lord.’</span></span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Dear ones, has such been your experience? Have
your crops failed in this manner, and suffered for
want of rain? Let us read further: <span class="tei tei-q">‘Return unto me,
and I will return unto you, saith the Lord of hosts.
But ye said, Wherein shall we return? Will a man
rob God? Yet ye have robbed me. But ye say,
Wherein have we robbed thee? In tithes and offerings.
Ye are cursed with a curse: for ye have
robbed me, even this whole nation. Bring ye all the
tithes into the storehouse, that there may be meat
in mine house, and prove me now herewith, saith the
Lord of hosts, if I will not open you the windows
of heaven, and pour you out a blessing, that there
shall not be room enough to receive it. And I will
rebuke the devourer for your sakes, and he shall not
destroy [corrupt, margin] the fruit of your ground;
neither shall your vine cast her fruits before the time
in the field, saith the Lord of hosts.’</span> Mal. 3:7-11.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Bring in the tithes and offerings, that God may be
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page347">[pg 347]</span><a name="Pg347" id="Pg347" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
pleased with you, and bless your labors that they
be profitable. Before we proceed further, let us
notice what offerings are accepted with God. <span class="tei tei-q">‘But
to do good and to communicate [share] forget not: for
with such sacrifices God is well pleased.’</span> Heb. 13:16.
To whom shall we communicate, or with whom shall
we share? <span class="tei tei-q">‘Let him that is taught in the Word communicate
unto him that teacheth in all good things....
And let us not be weary in well-doing: for in due
season we shall reap, if we faint not.’</span> Gal. 6:6-9.
Here is one class. Share with those who teach you in
the Word. <span class="tei tei-q">‘Distributing to the necessity of saints:
given to hospitality.’</span> Rom. 12:13. Distribute to
needy saints, and God will never let you come to
want for so doing. There is yet another class. <span class="tei tei-q">‘As
we have therefore opportunity, let us do good unto
all men, especially unto them who are of the household
of faith.’</span> Gal. 6:10.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“We will now look into the New Testament Scriptures
to see what God has promised there. These are
Jesus' own words: <span class="tei tei-q">‘Give, and it shall be given unto
you; good measure, pressed down, and shaken together,
and running over, shall men give into your
bosom. For with the same measure ye mete withal
it shall be measured to you again.’</span> Luke 6:38. Surely
if any one is needy, he had better begin giving and
receive the hundredfold. No danger of coming to
want with such a promise from the great God hanging
over you. Move out and no longer fear; for
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page348">[pg 348]</span><a name="Pg348" id="Pg348" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
<span class="tei tei-q">‘my God shall supply all your need according to
his riches in glory by Christ Jesus.’</span> Phil. 4:19.
<span class="tei tei-q">‘Yes,’</span> says some one, <span class="tei tei-q">‘you ministers and gospel workers
can depend upon God for what you need, but
we must work for what we get.’</span> Will you please
turn to Phil. 4:9 and read on down very carefully.
You will see that Paul was writing to them concerning
giving; telling them how once and again he had
received their gifts, and how he is still encouraging
them to give more. He says, <span class="tei tei-q">‘Not because I desire a
gift: but I desire fruit that may abound to your
account.’</span> Ver. 17. And that he had received <span class="tei tei-q">‘the
things which were sent from you, an odor of a sweet
smell, a sacrifice acceptable, well-pleasing to God.’</span>
[Giving to the poor and needy, or sending the gospel
to those who sit in darkness, is an odorous sacrifice
to God. How beautiful! The remembrance of our
deeds of charity and hospitality being a sweet odor
unto God must make such offerings a delight—<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Auth.</span></span>]
Then he gives them this great promise that God would
supply all their needs. He was not talking to preachers
at all, although we can rest upon this promise, but
to the church at Philippi. And the same Lord is
rich unto all who call upon him. Praise his name!</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Now, you who are at home laboring in temporal
things, and can not go yourselves to minister the
Word of God to others, just let go of everything and
get down before God and ask him how much you can
give to help this work along. Here is an opportunity
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page349">[pg 349]</span><a name="Pg349" id="Pg349" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
to do good to all men. And <span class="tei tei-q">‘as ye have therefore
opportunity, do good unto all men,’</span> then you can take
these promises for your own and depend upon God to
supply all your needs. You can and need to be
just as much given up to God, and just as dependent
upon him as the ministry is. Who will help now, by
means and prayers, to send the gospel to every creature
and every land?”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Good works do not cease with giving. There are
many opportunities for all to do good that God might
be glorified. Even the poor will find many opportunities
for doing something that will benefit some
fellow creature, exalt the name of Jesus and bring
a blessing to their own soul. There are the sick and the
discouraged to be visited and prayed with. There are
kind and sympathetic words that need to be spoken
to lighten the burden of some weary heart. All
around us are opportunities for loving deeds and good
works that can be done as unto Jesus, which are
precious treasures being laid up for us in the glory
world.

<h3 class="tei tei-head" style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 2.40em; margin-top: 2.40em"><span style="font-size: 120%">Eating Of Meats.</span></h3>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Many are the arguments on this subject from the
pulpit and the press, from the wise and not wise;
and many have been deceived and led to believe that
to eat or refuse to eat certain kinds of meat is a
duty they either owe to themselves or to God. Many
professed gospel preachers spend much time in discussing
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page350">[pg 350]</span><a name="Pg350" id="Pg350" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
this subject of meats, and would have their
followers believe that the eating of certain kinds of
meat is an offense against God, and through their
selfishness and ignorance endeavor to prove their
arguments from the law of Moses, which was absolutely
done away with when Christ died on the cross
as a sacrifice for the sins of the world. I have no more
to do with the law of Moses than I have with any law
that has been repealed by the last act of Congress.
It is disannulled and taken away by the one that
succeeds it. Paul says, <span class="tei tei-q">“Christ the end of the law
for righteousness to every one that believeth.”</span> Rom.
10:4.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The law was merely a temporary form of government
until Christ should come, to whom the promise
was made. It served as a schoolmaster to bring us to
Christ, but when Christ came we were no longer under
a schoolmaster. Gal. 3:19, 24.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Christ is become of no effect unto you, whosoever
of you are justified by the law; ye are fallen from
grace.”</span> Gal. 5:4. <span class="tei tei-q">“That no man is justified by the
law in the sight of God, it is evident: for, The just
shall live by faith.”</span> Gal. 3:11. <span class="tei tei-q">“Christ hath redeemed
us from the curse of the law.”</span> Gal. 3:13. These scriptures
show plainly that the law of Moses can not
be taken as proof of the righteousness which Jesus
Christ established; for, says the apostle, <span class="tei tei-q">“The law was
given by Moses, but grace and truth came by Jesus
Christ.”</span> John 1:17. So then the law was neither
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page351">[pg 351]</span><a name="Pg351" id="Pg351" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
grace nor truth as regards matters pertaining to you
and me.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The New Testament Scriptures settle most questions
beyond all doubts, and leave no room for discussion.
Paul speaks very lightly of this matter of
eating meats, and his language shows it to be of no
importance whatever. He says, <span class="tei tei-q">“Meats for the belly,
and the belly for meats: but God shall destroy both
it and them.”</span> 1 Cor 6:13. <span class="tei tei-q">“For the kingdom of
God is not meat and drink; but righteousness, and
peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost.”</span> Rom. 14:17. The
apostle means to set forth the idea that the kingdom
of God has nothing to do with meat and drink, and
such trifling things as dieting ourselves is not taken
into consideration. But the kingdom of God is righteousness,
peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost; it
is a spiritual, not a physical existence. I may eat all
kinds of meat and be in the kingdom of God or I
may eat no meat and be in the kingdom of God.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Christ said, <span class="tei tei-q">“There is nothing from without a
man, that entering into him can defile him; but the
things which come out of him.... Are ye so without
understanding also? do ye not perceive that whatsoever
thing from without entereth into the man it can not defile
him; ... because it entereth not into his heart, but
into the belly, and goeth out into the draught, purging
all meats.”</span> Mark 7:15, 19. <span class="tei tei-q">“That which cometh
out of the man, that defileth the man. For from
within, out of the heart of men, proceed evil thoughts,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page352">[pg 352]</span><a name="Pg352" id="Pg352" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
adulteries, fornications, murders, thefts, covetousness,
wickedness, deceit, lasciviousness, an evil eye, blasphemy,
pride, foolishness: all these evil things come
from within and defile the man.”</span> Mark 7:20-23.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Paul says, <span class="tei tei-q">“Let not him that eateth despise him
that eateth not; and let not him which eateth not
judge him that eateth: for God hath received him.”</span>
Rom. 14:3. <span class="tei tei-q">“I know and am persuaded by the Lord
Jesus that there is nothing unclean of itself: but to
him that esteemeth anything to be unclean, to him it
is unclean.”</span> Rom. 14:14. And again, <span class="tei tei-q">“Let no man
therefore judge you in meat, or in drink, or in respect
of an holy day, or of the new moon, or of the sabbath
days.”</span> Col. 2:16. Paul says, <span class="tei tei-q">“The Spirit
speaketh expressly [notice he says the Spirit speaketh
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">expressly</span></em>], that in the latter time some shall
depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits,
and doctrines of devils: speaking lies in hypocrisy;
having their conscience seared with a hot iron; forbidding
to marry, and commanding to abstain from
meats which God hath created to be received with
thanksgiving of them which believe and know the
truth. For every creature of God is good, and nothing
to be refused, if it be received with thanksgiving:
for it is sanctified by the Word of God and
prayer.”</span> 1 Tim. 4:1-5.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Now note carefully the apostles language. Those
who forbid to marry and command to abstain from
meats are classed with those who hold forth the doctrine
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page353">[pg 353]</span><a name="Pg353" id="Pg353" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of devils, and speak lies in hypocrisy. It is the
doctrine of devils to say that any meat is unclean;
for said he, God created them and they are his creatures.
Then he goes on to say to Timothy, <span class="tei tei-q">“If thou
put the brethren in remembrance of these things,
thou shalt be a good minister of Jesus Christ, nourished
up in the words of faith and of good doctrine,
whereunto thou hast attained.”</span> 1 Tim. 4:6. If any
kind of meat is offensive to me, there is no law either
natural or divine that says I must eat. I have a
right to abstain from it if I choose. It is no sin for
me to do that, but I have no right to say to others,
It is a sin for you to eat pork or any other kind of
meat.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
From these texts of Scripture we learn that all
manner of sin is pardonable, save one, the blasphemy
against the Holy Ghost. There is no crime too great,
or sin too deeply dyed to be forgiven, except the
one designated in these scriptures. Well might it
be asked, What is that sin? It is evident that the
Holy Spirit (which is the same as the Holy Ghost)
is no more supreme or important than others of the
trinity; so therefore why should all blasphemy against
the Father or Son be pardonable, and the blasphemy
of the Holy Spirit be unpardonable. The answer
will be found to lie in the nature and office work
of the Holy Spirit, as being different from that of the
Father or Son. Of course the Father, Son, and Holy
Spirit are all one; yet they might well be considered
as three, when we speak of their respective offices.
The Father, the grand author of all good, the Creator
of the world, the one who holdeth all things in his
control, the designer of the glorious plan of redemption
of fallen man. The Son, the one on whom
that redemption depended, who only was found worthy
to open the book and loose the seals of the divine
plan, and thus make salvation possible. The Holy
Spirit, the one who, after the Father and Son had
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page355">[pg 355]</span><a name="Pg355" id="Pg355" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
perfected their work, was sent to reprove the world of
sin, of righteousness, and of judgment. He it is that
strives with men by way of a kind of inherent knowledge,
testifying to them of salvation's waters flowing
free, and that they should forsake sin and plunge
therein. By the Holy Spirit is God's way of manifesting
himself to men, convicting them of sin, righteousness,
and judgment. True, as Paul says, God
<span class="tei tei-q">“hath in these last days spoken unto us by his Son;”</span>
but notice, it is <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">hath spoken</span></em>.”</span> The Son has done
his part, we have his words on record, and he is
at the right hand of the Father; and he has himself
said that he would go away, that the Comforter
(Holy Spirit) might come. And now we are living
in the special dispensation of the Holy Spirit.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The sin against the Holy Ghost, as it is commonly
called, is also known as the <span class="tei tei-q">“unpardonable sin,”</span> and
the <span class="tei tei-q">“sin unto death.”</span> See 1 John 5:16. As we
before said, the answer to the question, Why is it
unpardonable, lies in the very nature of the Holy
Spirit's relationship to man. Are we to suppose that
it is some sin too heinous to be forgiven? or that
God has decided that this sin is one that bears too
heavily against his willingness to forgive? or, in
other words, that his great love is not sufficient, were
it weighed in the balance with this sin? Nay; that is
not the light in which it is to be regarded. This is a
sin that is different in its effects from other sins. It
is one by which man unprivileges himself to be saved.
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page356">[pg 356]</span><a name="Pg356" id="Pg356" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
He disconnects himself, so to speak, from all possible
operations or strivings of the Spirit of God with him.
He might blaspheme God, or the Son, and it would
be the same as any other sin. But he blasphemes the
Spirit whenever he takes action against (and casts
out, so to speak) that inherent principle in him which
tends to draw him to God. By so doing he places himself
outside the realm of possibilities, as regards his
own salvation: for he severs all possible communication
from God to him, unless it be what is manifest
by the presentation of awful fear of approaching
damnation.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It will be seen that in committing this sin a man by
choice wilfully places himself in such a position, in
reference to the inner dictations of the Spirit, that
the latter is killed or destroyed. He can blaspheme
God, and the convictions of the Spirit in him be unaffected,
save that continual so doing might lessen them;
but when he blasphemes the Spirit—it being so interwoven
as to be, in a sense, a part of himself—he involves
his own soul, by taking a stand against himself,
as it were, thereby unfitting and unqualifying
himself to be further affected by the Spirit. He
drowns, dissolves, annihilates the inner strivings of
the Spirit.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
If we examine carefully the quotation from Mark, we
see by verse thirty that the reason Christ said what he
did about blasphemy against the Holy Ghost was because
certain scribes said he had an unclean spirit,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page357">[pg 357]</span><a name="Pg357" id="Pg357" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
and cast out devils by Beelzebub, the prince of devils.
Now whether they thereby committed the blasphemy
of the Spirit, we do not know; but from Christ's
words that followed, a strong inference could be drawn
that they did. It was at least a close step to it, and
depended on the degree of inherent knowledge they
had that Jesus was the Christ. If they did it ignorantly,
it was not blasphemy.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In the sixth chapter of the Hebrews, verses four to
eight, the apostle speaks of such as have been partakers
of the Holy Ghost, and were enlightened, etc., who, if
they shall <span class="tei tei-q">“fall away,”</span> directly disinherit themselves
of the privilege of being renewed unto repentance,
and <span class="tei tei-q">“crucify <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">to themselves</span></em> the Son of God afresh,
and put him to an open shame.”</span> By so doing they
virtually do violence to the Spirit's convictions to
such an extent that they blaspheme the Spirit. We
are persuaded that Paul here had no reference to a
person being overcome of the devil in some great
temptation so as to commit sin, while at the same time
the soul protests against sin. That would not be <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">falling
away</span></em> (as here meant) from the love, neither the
faith of God. Indeed, it is the very love of God, as
well as the Spirit's convictions, that causes such a one
to have immediate sorrow for the sin committed, and
causes the soul to quickly flee to God again. But
what the apostle meant by <span class="tei tei-q">“falling away”</span> was to forsake
the Lord, give up the faith, walk no more in the
truth or with God's children, and be content to live
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page358">[pg 358]</span><a name="Pg358" id="Pg358" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
in sin. But take notice of the standard which he
gives, from which <span class="tei tei-q">“falling away”</span> may be considered.
He says, <span class="tei tei-q">“those who were once enlightened,”</span> had
<span class="tei tei-q">“tasted of the heavenly gift,”</span> were <span class="tei tei-q">“partakers of the
Holy Ghost,”</span> had <span class="tei tei-q">“tasted the good word of God, and
the powers of the world to come;”</span> if such fall away—forsake
the Lord and choose to live in sin—they soon
become incapable of being affected by any manifestation
of the Spirit or any inducement held out to them—a
deplorable, lost condition! bearing only thorns
and briers! whose end is to be burned! Now we ask,
Who ever saw any one come back to God who was
content to remain away from God, after having had
the experience described in Heb. 6:4, 5? We have
seen some who exactly correspond to the description
Paul gives here, but we have never known any such
to come back to the truth. May we use this, as the
apostle intended it, as a warning against unfaithfulness
to God.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In Heb. 10:26-29 the apostle makes mention of the
same conditions, only in a different way. Here he
speaks of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">sinning wilfully</span></em> <span class="tei tei-q">“after that we have received
the knowledge of the truth.”</span> Of course, all
sin, to be sin, is done more or less wilfully; but the
apostle can not have reference to a sin committed on
account of a spiritual lack, while the soul meaningly
presses on in the race for God. We know that such
a sin does not unfit one to become pardoned again,
the Holy Spirit is not blasphemed, and therefore the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page359">[pg 359]</span><a name="Pg359" id="Pg359" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
sacrifice (Christ) still remains, to which the soul may
flee. To <span class="tei tei-q">“sin wilfully”</span> here means more, as is unmistakably
implied in verses twenty-eight and twenty-nine.
He illustrates by one who despised Moses' law,
as though he now means one who is despising the law
of Christ; and he explains himself in verse twenty-nine,
where we see he has reference to one <span class="tei tei-q">“who hath
trodden under foot the Son of God, and hath counted
the blood of the covenant, wherewith he was sanctified,
an unholy thing, and hath done despite unto the
Spirit of grace.”</span> Here <span class="tei tei-q">“sin wilfully”</span> comprehends
the blasphemy of the Spirit, and he evidently means,
by the term, a wilful turning again to a life of sin,
a deliberate giving up of the faith, and choosing sin
instead. This is also used as a stimulus to the saints
to exhort one another, and neglect not the assembling
of themselves together, or the provoking unto love
and good works, etc.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
From these two places in the Hebrews it might be
supposed that to be in an unpardonable condition a
person must have once been saved. But the apostle
in both places is necessarily addressing saved people,
and holds up such a condition as a warning against
unfaithfulness. He deals in what is applicable to
them. But this does not prove that a man who has
never known the way of truth may not also place himself
where he is unpardonable.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It is safe and Scriptural to take the stand that a
person is pardonable so long as he is capable of being
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page360">[pg 360]</span><a name="Pg360" id="Pg360" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
sorry for his sin, for God's sake, or of having a
real desire to love and serve God. The promise and
privilege is to <span class="tei tei-q">“whosoever will.”</span> This is as broad as
broad can be, and whoever wills can know assuredly
that salvation is for him, not withstanding the disputations
of the devil to the contrary. In Heb. 12:16, 17
one would infer from the apostle's illustration of
Esau that a person can be in a condition where repentance
may be earnestly desired, even with tears,
yet impossible to be found. But genuine repentance
is not implied here. The margin has it, <span class="tei tei-q">“He [Esau]
found no place to change his mind,”</span> instead of <span class="tei tei-q">“no
place for repentance.”</span> A person may commit the
unpardonable sin and still desire to change his condition
or lot; he may through fear of eternal damnation
desire rather the position of a Christian: but he
never repents, he can not repent, it is not <span class="tei tei-q">“in him”</span>
to repent, he will not meet the conditions for salvation,
and no one can get him to do so. He may
bewail his condition and stand in dread of the judgment,
from a feeling of selfish protection; he may be
sorry for his sins as a criminal may be sorry for
his crime when he is sentenced to be punished: but
he has no inclination to godly sorrow; in fact,
the spirit of the man and the Spirit of God are
incompatible; he has placed himself where the Spirit
of God can in no way bring itself to bear upon him.
Oh, how awful is such a state! But he is not conscious
of any awfulness from having offended God;
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page361">[pg 361]</span><a name="Pg361" id="Pg361" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
his awfulness proceeds from a sense of his being eternally
lost. The only impulses that might draw such
a one to seek the Christian state are those of the
selfish kind, just as a man may desire salvation from
a belief that it would be conducive to his selfish interest.
A person will never get an experience of salvation
through such motives; and in the case of the one
who has committed the blasphemy of the Spirit, he
may have such motives, but he can never have the
genuine kind, or in other words, be drawn of the
Spirit. Such a sin need not be prayed for. 1 John 5:16.
It is certainly a sin unto death.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In conclusion we would say that the unpardonable
sin is not to be regarded as some particular sin, singled
out from all others, as though it were some form
of murder, lying, or stealing, more heinous than the
rest. But it lies in the nature of the sin committed,
as affecting the relationship with the Holy Spirit. A
person may have committed a whole list of the blackest
crimes, and yet not have committed the unpardonable
sin; or vice versa, a person may have a good
standing in point of morality, and yet have blasphemed
the Spirit, and severed himself from all possibility
of repentance. We would say to every despairing
soul seeking salvation, that if you are capable
of having the least godly sorrow on account of
your sin, or a real, inward desire to serve God, you
can rest assured that you have not committed the
unpardonable sin. If you feel the Spirit of God telling
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page362">[pg 362]</span><a name="Pg362" id="Pg362" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
you that you ought to be saved, then salvation
is for you. The unpardonable sin deprives a person
of the desire to will to love and serve God and obey
the truth. So in the language of Scripture we continue
to hold out the blessed invitation—<span class="tei tei-q">“Whosoever
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">will</span></em>, let him take the water of life freely.”</span> Amen.

<h3 class="tei tei-head" style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 2.40em; margin-top: 2.40em"><span style="font-size: 120%">The Conscience.</span></h3>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
When we behold the mechanism of man, we are
made to exclaim with the Psalmist, <span class="tei tei-q">“I am fearfully
and wonderfully made; marvelous are thy works; and
that my soul knoweth right well.”</span> Man is so constituted
as to experience a feeling of joy when a desired
object is obtained, or a feeling of disappointment
if it is not obtained. When danger approaches he
intuitively seeks to avert it, and experiences a feeling
of gladness if he succeeds. Among the elements of
man's moral nature the highest and most important,
perhaps, is the conscience. Conscience is a principle
which God has placed in man's moral being to teach
him what is right and what is wrong. Some have said
that conscience is the <span class="tei tei-q">“voice of God in the soul.”</span> It
is a voice that is inaudible to the ear, but we feel it
speaking in us, saying, <span class="tei tei-q">“This action is right,”</span> or,
<span class="tei tei-q">“That action is wrong.”</span> We believe that Solomon
was referring to the conscience when he said, <span class="tei tei-q">“The
spirit of man is the candle of the Lord, searching all
the inward parts of the belly.”</span> Prov. 20:27.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Where there is no known law, conscience becomes
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page363">[pg 363]</span><a name="Pg363" id="Pg363" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
our guide and the standard by which we are judged.
For proof of this we will quote Rom. 2:14, 15: <span class="tei tei-q">“For
when the Gentiles, which have not a law, do by nature
[a kind of intuitive knowledge of right] the
things contained in the law, these, having not the
law, are a law unto themselves; which shew the work
of the law written in their hearts, their conscience
also bearing witness, and their thoughts the
meanwhile accusing or else excusing one another.”</span>
In many circumstances of life we have no written
law of God to guide our actions, consequently must
be directed by reason and conscience, which are highly
analogous. To be perfectly and properly directed
by the conscience necessitates a close walk with God.
<span class="tei tei-q">“Keeping in touch with God”</span> is God in our conscious
being, impressing us with proper actions, and leading
us in the right way, and showing us the relationship
existing between the pure soul and the Deity. Where
there is no written law of God to direct the actions in
a certain circumstance, those who experience a close
connection with God will always act the most wisely;
because the <span class="tei tei-q">“candle of the Lord”</span> (the conscience) is
a light in them, impressing them with feelings of
right in the matter.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The conscious principle in the moral nature suffered
greatly in the fall of man, and is seriously impaired
by violation of the known laws of God, or laws of
conscience. There is a beautiful harmony between
truth and a correct conscience. Obedience to the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page364">[pg 364]</span><a name="Pg364" id="Pg364" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
truth is always approved by an unimpaired conscience.
When a known truth is violated, a searing influence
is introduced upon the conscience, which grows with
every violation, until the conscience becomes seared
as with a hot iron. Dangers of delusion lie in the
fact that after a succession of violations, the conscience
becomes so morbid that it fails to be a correct judge of
action. After a time a man can violate a plain truth
without experiencing any sting of conscience; therefore
he concludes his actions are right, because he experiences
no condemnation, though they are in opposition
to the truth. There is great beauty in the
thought, and gratification in the knowledge, that by
obedience to the truth we can obtain a sound moral
condition, whose conscientious principles are so acute
that there is a timely warning at every approach of
error.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
To possess a purged, pure, and undefiled conscience
is our privilege in the economy of grace. See Heb.
9:14; 1 Tim. 3:9; Titus 1:15. To possess an unimpaired
conscience and then so meet all our obligations
to God and man is to have a conscience void
of offense. What implicit confidence we can have in
God when in a normal moral condition, and have an
uncondemned heart. Enoch walked with God and
had the witness (consciousness) that he pleased the
Lord. What can bring greater happiness to the heart
of man? The man who, having an undefiled moral
being has a conscience void of offense toward God and
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page365">[pg 365]</span><a name="Pg365" id="Pg365" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
man, experiences a satisfaction and a happiness unsurpassed
by any mortal being.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The Scriptures talk of two classes of people on the
earth. The inhabitants of this globe are by the Word
of God divided into two great families. One family is
termed the righteous, and the other the unrighteous.
One is the godly, the other the ungodly. One is the
holy, the other the unholy. The righteous family is
likened unto or called sheep, the unrighteous family,
goats. Mat. 25:32, 33. They are interspersed
throughout the earth. When the Son of man is come
they shall be separated. One family shall be admitted
into an eternity of bliss, the other into an eternity
of punishment. One family is represented by a
good tree, the other by an evil tree. In the parable of
the sower the Savior likens one family unto wheat,
and the other unto tares.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Since there are two families there are, of course,
two fathers. God is the Father of one of these families
(2 Cor. 6:18), and Satan is the father of the
other, John 8:44. These fathers are sometimes called
masters. <span class="tei tei-q">“One is your Master, even God.”</span> Now every
individual on the globe is either in servitude to
one or the other of these masters—never to both.
<span class="tei tei-q">“No man can serve two masters.”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“His servants ye
are to whom ye obey, whether of sin unto death or of
obedience unto righteousness.”</span>
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page366">[pg 366]</span><a name="Pg366" id="Pg366" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The Scriptures so plainly locate the dividing line
between these two families that all can very well
know to which family they belong. Those who are
born into God's family do not commit sin. 1 John
3:9; 1 John 5:18. Those belong to the devil's family
who do commit sin. 1 John 3:8. This is very
plain. None need be mistaken. Those who do not
commit sin are the wheat or good seed, and are children
of the kingdom. Those who do commit sin are
the tares or children of the wicked one. Mat. 13.
Those who do not commit sin have their names written
in heaven. But those who sin do not have their
names written there (Ex. 32:33), therefore are not
members in the family of God.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It is said that some people are mistaken as to which
family they belong, but it is <span class="tei tei-q">“not every one that
saith, Lord, Lord, that shall enter into the kingdom of
heaven.”</span> God's family are righteous, they are holy,
they are pure, they are saints. Satan's family are
unrighteous, they are unholy, they do not believe
in purity, they commit sin. The Savior has gone to
prepare a place for his own so that where he is there
they may forever be—glory! glory! Those who live
and die in sin can not go to that pure and happy
place. John 8:21. Dear friend, get ready. Live a
pure, holy life and spend an eternity in the blissful
presence of our dear Redeemer. God bless you, is my
sincere prayer.

are two abodes or dwelling-places for man in that
eternity. One is called heaven, the other is called hell.
One is a place of peace and joy, the other a place of

death and evil. The way to heaven is denominated the
holy way, where walk the redeemed. The ransomed
ones go singing on this way with crowns of joy upon
their heads. This way shines more and more, brighter
and brighter, as it nears the end.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The way to hell is denominated the way of the
transgressor. It is a hard way. There is no peace
there, no rest. The darkness becomes more dense,

everlasting life in heaven is called a narrow way.
Mat. 7:14. There are few that walk this way. The
way that leads to destruction is a broad way. Mat.
7:13. There are many who are walking in that way.

We have now reached the conclusion of the first
division of the Gospel Day, namely, The Morning.
We have not given the reader our opinion, or our interpretation
of the Scriptures, but we have given the
pure, simple Bible truths as taught by Christ and the
apostles. It is not our doctrine, but the doctrine of
him that sent us. What we have taught is in perfect
accord with the Bible, and who can gainsay it?
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
To believe, experience, and live the truths of God's
Word is to be a light in the world. To disbelieve any
part, to come short of any part in practical life, is to
be to the same extent in darkness. Christ was a light
because he was the Word. The early church and apostles
were a light because they believed, experienced
and practised in life the whole Word. The Bible was
written in their hearts as well as in the book. The
Bible never changes. God never changes, the nature
of faith and grace never changes, and true gospel light
never changes. What created light in the first century
of this Christian era will create light in any other
century, and nothing but what was light in the primitive
days of Christianity will be light at any other
time. Whatever may be claimed to be light, if it is
not the light of Christ, is a false light.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
May God help people to see the true light. Oh,
glorious light of the morning! Christ and his church
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page369">[pg 369]</span><a name="Pg369" id="Pg369" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
in all humility, gentleness, spotlessness and love. In
their lowly, inoffensive walk with God, holy, harmless,
undefiled, unblamable, separated from and unspotted
by the world, persecuted, rejected, and despised
by men. Enduring all without a murmur,
contented in any and every circumstance of life;
counting everything joy, glorying in tribulation, patient
in imprisonments, in stripes, in tumults, in hunger,
in fastings, in necessities, in afflictions, in distresses,
always rejoicing. When reviled, they reviled not
again; when they suffered they threatened not, but
showing all meekness and gentleness unto all men,
loving and praying for their enemies, feeding them
when they hungered and giving them drink when they
thirsted, preaching the gospel without money and
without price, led exclusively by the Holy Spirit,
having power with God over devils to cast them out,
to heal the sick and lame, to restore sight to the
blind and hearing to the deaf, to give speech to the
dumb, and to raise the dead. Wonderful light of
the gospel morning! Dear reader, we invite you to
look upon the picture. See it in its beautiful transparent
effulgent light. Pure as heaven, holy as a
band of angels, peaceful as the silent, flowing river,
harmless as the gentle dove, in a oneness equal with
the holy trinity, and conquerors of sickness, sin and
Satan. Such was the pure virgin bride of Christ—the
church—when she was the light of the world.

The prophet Isaiah said. <span class="tei tei-q">“The morning cometh,
and also the night.”</span> Isa. 21:11, 12. A dark night
succeeded the morning of this gospel day. Jesus said
to his disciples, <span class="tei tei-q">“But in those days, after that tribulation,
the sun shall be darkened, and the moon shall
not give her light.”</span> Mark 13:24. The tribulation
here spoken of was the siege and destruction of Jerusalem,
the city of the Jews, by the son of Vespasian,
A.D. 70, in which eleven hundred thousand persons
perished. Josephus says of this time, <span class="tei tei-q">“The sufferings
indeed of the devoted inhabitants are such as humanity
shudders to contemplate, and over which pity
is glad to throw a veil.”</span> This is the tribulation of
which our Lord spoke. The darkening of the sun

About the year 96 A.D. the writings of the New
Testament were closed. From that time we have only
history to tell us of Christianity and its light in the
life of men. That the noontime of this gospel day
was dark, is unquestionable. To ascertain as near as
possible the date of the close of the morning light
and the beginning of the dark noonday we must resort
to history. No one can rightly object to this.
We assure you we will extract nothing that will conflict

Where the Word of truth is silent and we can gain information
from authentic history it must certainly
be proper and right. Historical facts only verify

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In speaking of Constantine's expedition to Rome
in the year 311, when there appeared supernaturally
a cross above the sun, he says: <span class="tei tei-q">“During the vicissitudes
in the state, the church exhibits nothing peculiarly
great. Among the common people there were
doubtless many truly devoted in the spirit of their
mind, and among them many that loved the divine
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page372">[pg 372]</span><a name="Pg372" id="Pg372" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Savior above life itself; but among the bishops and
pastors nothing like what we saw in the past century.
Indeed the principal events in the internal department
of the church are rather more to its disgrace
than its honor.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Speaking further of this time in another chapter
he says: <span class="tei tei-q">“The pagan temples were pulled down or
converted into Christian churches: the exercise of the
old priesthood was proscribed and the idols destroyed;
elegant structures for Christian worship were raised,
and those already erected, enlarged and beautified;
the episcopacy was increased and honored with great
favors and enriched with vast endowments; the ritual
received many additions; the habiliments of the clergy
were pompous, and the whole of the Christian service
at once exhibited a scene of worldly grandeur
and external parade. What a mighty change! But
a short time since, and Christianity was held in sovereign
contempt: now she is a favorite at court, and
the companion of princes. Alas! such is the change,
that it scarcely affords ground for triumph. The
kingdom of our God and his Christ is become a kingdom
of this world, and the church of Jesus reduced
to a mere worldly sanctuary. The glory is departed,
the gold is become dim, and the fine gold is changed.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Indeed prelatical pride had been rising very high
for a century before this. The pastors had forgotten
their Master's instruction. <span class="tei tei-q">‘Be ye not called Rabbi:
for ye are brethren.’</span> Lord bishops and archbishops
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page373">[pg 373]</span><a name="Pg373" id="Pg373" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
and all the spirit of such distinction had been long
enough upon the advance to congratulate such an emperor
as Constantine. The materials for a hierarchy
having been prepared it was no difficult thing for a
set of worldly-minded bishops, countenanced by a
prince, to put them together. Under all these circumstances,
real religion was not likely to be bettered
by such a reverse in external affairs, and so the event
proved. The ancient contest, which was for the faith
once delivered unto the saints, declined apace, and a
strife for worldly honor, fleshly gratification, and
spiritual dominion substituted in its stead.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Such was the true condition of things in the year
311. Surely there had been a change, the kingdom of
God had become the kingdom of the world, the glory
was gone, strivings for worldly honor, fleshly gratification,
and spiritual dominion had taken the place of
<span class="tei tei-q">“striving for the faith once delivered to the saints.”</span>
What a change from the humble, self-denying, flesh
crucifying days of Christ and the apostles. Truly we
can say sometime before this the morning light had
dimmed and died, and darkness intervened. The historian
does not fix this date (311) as the beginning of
the dark noonday. (The reader already begins to
see, no doubt, why it was dark at the noontime.) He
says in a preceding chapter, <span class="tei tei-q">“About A.D. 264, a considerable
stir was made by Paul of Samosata, bishop
of Antioch. <span class="tei tei-q">‘Great was the falling off in this church
since the renowned Ignatius. The principles of Paul
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page374">[pg 374]</span><a name="Pg374" id="Pg374" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
were exceedingly loose, and his practise was correspondent.’</span>
He rejected the divinity of the Son and
substituted his own reason for the light of the Spirit.
The way in which he lived fully proved that he was
a man of the world.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The historian proceeds to tell more of this bishop's
wicked life. The Scriptural qualifications of a bishop
are, blamelessness, the husband of one wife, vigilant,
sober, of good behavior, given to hospitality,
apt to teach; <span class="tei tei-q">“not given to wine, no striker, not
greedy of filthy lucre; but patient, not a brawler, not
covetous; one that ruleth well his own house, having
his children in subjection with all gravity.”</span> 1 Tim.
3:3, 4. The seventh verse adds: <span class="tei tei-q">“Moreover he must
have a good report of them which are without.”</span> Such
a bishop must be, in the very strictest sense, to be
a light in the world. Here was a bishop, of perhaps
the strongest Christian congregation in the world, almost
everything to the contrary. How true the Savior's
prophecy: <span class="tei tei-q">“The moon shall not give her light,
and the stars of heaven shall fall.”</span> Paul, of Samosata,
became so wicked he was deposed from his office and
became a <span class="tei tei-q">“fallen star.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Sabine speaking of divisions and their causes says:
<span class="tei tei-q">“In this century the general church was rent in twain.
This century also produced a train of other officers
(beside bishops and deacons), such as subdeacons,
who were all to the deacon what the presbyter was to
the bishop; acolytes, persons to attend at service time
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page375">[pg 375]</span><a name="Pg375" id="Pg375" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
on the ministers; ostiaries, doorkeepers; readers, men
who were appointed to read the Scriptures in public;
exorcists, officers of weak and superstitious appointment,
whose business was to pretend to expel the devil
from the candidate for baptism. All these encroachments
and changes mark, strongly mark, a great decline
in the spirit and power of primitive Christianity.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
All of these things, and many more similar ones,
were occurring in the latter part of the third century.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In the year of our Lord 248 Cyprian was ordained
a presbyter in the church at Carthage. Ten years
later he laid down his life for Jesus. It is said of
him that he <span class="tei tei-q">“displayed a benevolent and pious mind
and evinced much of the character of the Christian
pastor in the affectionate solicitude with which he
watched over his flock.”</span> In epistle eleven he says: <span class="tei tei-q">“It
must be owned and confessed that the outrageous and
heavy calamity which hath almost devoured our flock,
and continues to devour it to this day, hath happened
to us because of our sins, since we keep not the way
of the Lord, nor observe his heavenly commands,
which were designed to lead us to salvation. Christ
our Lord fulfilled the will of the Father, but we neglect
the will of Christ. Our principal study is to get
money and estates; we follow after pride, we are at
leisure for nothing but emulation and quarreling, and
have neglected the simplicity of faith. We have renounced
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page376">[pg 376]</span><a name="Pg376" id="Pg376" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
this world in words only, and not in deed.
Every one studies to please himself and to displease
others.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This account of professed Christianity at this time
by Cyprian is confirmed by the testimony of Eusebius,
who was nearly contemporary with him.
<span class="tei tei-q">“Through too much liberty they grew negligent and
slothful, envying and reproaching one another, waging,
as it were, civil wars among themselves, bishops
quarreling with bishops, and the people divided into
parties. Hypocrisy and deceit were grown to the
highest pitch of wickedness. They were become so insensible
as not so much as to think of appeasing the
divine anger; but like atheists they thought the world
destitute of any providential government and care,
and thus added one crime to another. The bishops
themselves had thrown off all concern about religion,
were perpetually contending with one another, and did
nothing but quarrel with and threaten and envy and
hate one another: they were full of ambition and
tyrannically used their power.”</span>—<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Eusebius' History</span></span>,

<span class="tei tei-q">“Several alterations in the form of church government
appear to have been introduced during the third
century. Some degree of pomp was thought necessary
to render so singular an institution respectable

of judging from external appearances. As their
numbers increased their labors became proportionally
greater, and it was necessary to provide assistance
and more agreeable to good order to assign to each
his proper function. Inferior ministers were therefore
instituted, who derived their appellations from
the office they filled.</span>

society, but from a certain proportion of the fixed
revenues of the church. The principal of them had
obtained before the close of this century the possession
of several considerable estates, which had been
bequeathed or presented to the church. The external
dignity of the ministers of religion was accompanied
by a still greater change in its discipline. The simple
rules prescribed by the apostles for the preservation
of good order in the church branched out into so
many luxuriant shoots that it was difficult to recognize
the parent stem.”</span>—p. 53.

Following this, Ruter gives an account of the penitents
seeking salvation who had to proceed step by
step. The first degree was to prostrate themselves in
the avenues of the church building. Here they were
called <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">flentes</span></span>. In the second degree they
were allowed to enter the building and hear the sermon. Here they
were called <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">audientes</span></span>. In the third degree
they were allowed to unite in prayers offered in their own behalf.
Here they were called <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">genuflectentes</span></span>. In the
fourth degree they were allowed to approach the altar
and were called <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">consistentes</span></span>. In the taking of
these degrees the penitents were compelled to appear
in sackcloth and ashes, and in some places the men
were obliged to shave their heads and the women to
wear veils. The duration of their penitence was regulated
by the bishop. He could make the time of taking
these degrees short, or extend it to any length.
This was called an indulgence.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This is shocking in the extreme. Where in the humble
acts of Jesus and his apostles do you hear of such
an order of things? Truly at this time the sun was
darkened, and the moon did not give her light, and the
stars had fallen. How true now appears the prophecy
of Isaiah: <span class="tei tei-q">“The people of thy holiness have possessed
it but a little while: our adversaries have trodden
down thy sanctuary.”</span> Isa. 63:18. Jesus says, <span class="tei tei-q">“Lay

Paul says to the bishop to be <span class="tei tei-q">“not greedy of filthy
lucre”</span>; and Peter says, <span class="tei tei-q">“Taking the oversight not
for filthy lucre's sake”</span>—and here before the close
of the third century we find the bishops coming into
possession of large estates through the revenues of
the church, and as Cyprian has said of the bishops
of this time, <span class="tei tei-q">“Our principal study is to get money
and estates.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
We have before us Mosheim's Church History. In
speaking of the internal history of the church in the
third century he says that <span class="tei tei-q">“the bishops of Rome,
Antioch and Alexandria had a kind of preeminence
over all others, and particularly the bishop at Rome.”</span>
There was a change in the form of government and
this change was followed by a train of vices. <span class="tei tei-q">“Many of
those who had the administration of the church affairs
were sunk,”</span> he says, <span class="tei tei-q">“in luxury and voluptuousness,
puffed up with vanity, arrogance and ambition; possessed
with a spirit of contention and discord. They
appropriated to their evangelical function the splendid
ensigns of temporal majesty: a throne, surrounded
with ministers, exalted above his equals, the servant
of the meek and humble Jesus.... The titles of subdeacons,
acolythi, ostairii, readers, exorcists, copiatæ,
would never have been heard of in the church if its
rulers had been assiduously and zealously employed
in promoting the interest of truth and piety by their
labors and their example.”</span> He gives an account of the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page380">[pg 380]</span><a name="Pg380" id="Pg380" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
trouble in the church of Rome between Cornelius and
Novatian, in the year 250, who were aspirants for the
Roman See.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Eusebius tells of the increasing vices, schisms, quarrelings
of the bishops, of their greed for money and
preeminence in the last half of the third century. In
speaking of the bishops and pastors who had the administration
of church government in the year 260,
he says: <span class="tei tei-q">“But some that appeared to be our pastors,
deserting the law of piety, were inflamed against each
other with mutual strifes, only accumulating quarrels
and threats, rivalship, hostility and hatred to each
other, only anxious to assert the government as a kind
of sovereignty for themselves.”</span> Then he adds, <span class="tei tei-q">“As
Jeremiah says, <span class="tei tei-q">‘The Lord in his anger darkened the
daughter of Sion [the church or moon], and hurled
from heaven to earth the glory of Israel.’</span> ”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
By this we learn that Eusebius would place the
darkening of the church, or the beginning of the dark
noonday, near the year 260 A.D. Quotations could
be transcribed from Coleman, Marsh, Waddington and
others, in which they all place the close of the morning
light and the rise of the apostasy or dark noonday
between the years 260 and 280 A.D. To our knowledge,
Joseph Milner is the only non-contemporary historian
that fixes the date to any definite time. He
says, <span class="tei tei-q">“I know it is common for authors to represent
the great declension of Christianity to have taken
place only after its external establishment under Constantine.
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page381">[pg 381]</span><a name="Pg381" id="Pg381" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
But the evidence of history has compelled
me to dissent from this view of things. In fact we
have seen that for a whole generation previous to the
persecution, few marks of superior piety appeared.
Scarce a luminary of godliness existed, and it is not
common in any age for a great work of the Spirit of
God to be exhibited but under the conduct of some
remarkable saint, pastor and reformers. This whole
period as well as the whole scene of the persecution
is very barren of such characters. Not but that many
precious children of God suffered in much patience
and charity. But those who suffered with very much
of a different spirit, found no pastor to discountenance
their self-will and false zeal: a sure sign that
the true spirit of martyrdom was less pure than it had
formerly been. Moreover the prevalence of superstition
on the one hand, and the decay of evangelical
knowledge on the other, are equally apparent. Christ
crucified, justification purely by faith, and the effectual
influences of the Holy Ghost, ... were ideas at
least very faintly impressed at that day on Christian
minds. It is vain to expect Christian faith to abound
without Christian doctrine. Moral and philosophical
and monastical instructions will not effect for men
what is expected from evangelical doctrine. And if
the faith of Christ was so much declined (and its
decayed state ought to be dated from about the year
270) we need not wonder that such scenes as Eusebius
hints at without any circumstantial detail took
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page382">[pg 382]</span><a name="Pg382" id="Pg382" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
After searching history we find no objection in
making use of the year 270 A.D. as the date of the
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">beginning of the dark noontime</span></em>. Milner says at
this time, <span class="tei tei-q">“Scarcely a luminary of godliness existed.
The great luminaries, or lights, were eclipsed and
darkness reigned. Some of our contemporary writers
have fixed upon this year as the date of the rise
of the beast power, which created this darkness.”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“The
real papacy was set up, not at the Nicene Council,
A.D. 325, as some affirm; but we find vivid
traces of the very same beast authority as early as
A.D. 270.”</span>—<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Biblical Trace of the Church.</span></span> In the
city of Nice in Bithynia, A.D. 325, was held what is
called <span class="tei tei-q">“The First General Council.”</span> There was present
at this council the Emperor Constantine, as the
historian says, <span class="tei tei-q">“Like an angel of God exceeding all
his attendants in size, gracefulness and strength, and
dazzling all eyes by the splendor of his dress, showing
the greatest humility, seated in a chair covered
with gold.”</span> There were present at this meeting three
hundred and eighteen bishops, and a number of deacons
and subdeacons, amounting in all to two thousand
and forty-eight persons. Here was drawn up
a creed, declaring to be the only true and orthodox
faith. It bears the title of Nicene. This creed was
at once confirmed at Rome by two hundred and
seventy-five bishops, and was the setting up of the
Roman hierarchy. This council can not however with
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page383">[pg 383]</span><a name="Pg383" id="Pg383" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
propriety be said to be the true setting up of the
beast power. Nearly all the forms and doctrines of
this creed had been observed and taught by the bishops
and pastors for several decades. The most sensible
date, and most consistent with revelation, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">for
the bringing in of the dark noontime of the gospel
day is A.D. 270</span></em>. We feel confident that no one can
rightfully object to us making use of this date for
this work. Those who do so must do it through prejudice
or ignorance.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Who has not wondered, as they read of the
Savior's and the apostles' warnings of <span class="tei tei-q">“false teachers,”</span>
grievous wolves, delusive powers, and deceptive
lights, what it all could mean? These things
certainly are not without meaning. Jesus says, <span class="tei tei-q">“And
many false prophets shall rise, and shall deceive
many. And because iniquity shall abound the love
of many shall wax cold. For there shall arise false
Christs, and false prophets, and shall show great
signs and wonders; insomuch that, if it were possible,
they shall deceive the very elect.”</span> Mat. 24:11, 12, 24.
The Son of God foretells the arising of
false prophets and teachers. He tells us how they
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page384">[pg 384]</span><a name="Pg384" id="Pg384" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
may be known. <span class="tei tei-q">“Beware of false prophets, which
come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly they
are ravening wolves. Ye shall know them by their
fruits.”</span> Mat. 7:15, 16.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
By the pen of the apostle John we learn something
of the fruit of these false, deceiving prophets. <span class="tei tei-q">“For
many deceivers are entered into the world, who confess
not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh. This
is a deceiver and an antichrist. Look to yourselves,
that we lose not those things which we have wrought,
but that we receive a full reward. Whosoever transgresseth,
and abideth not in the doctrine of Christ,
hath not God. He that abideth in the doctrine of
Christ, he hath both the Father and the Son. If there
come any unto you, and bring not this doctrine,
receive him not into your house, neither bid him
Godspeed: for he that biddeth him Godspeed is partaker
of his evil deeds.”</span> 2 John 7-11. The fruit of a
false prophet is a false doctrine. A doctrine in opposition
to the plain, simple doctrine of Christ is the
principal characterizing feature of a deceiver. The
doctrine of Christ is light. All who abide in the
doctrine of Christ are a light in the world. Any doctrine
contrary to the doctrine of Christ is darkness,
and its propagator, a deceiver and an antichrist.
This same apostle in his first letter, cautions us to
<span class="tei tei-q">“try the spirits [and doctrines], whether they are
of God: because many false prophets are gone out
into the world. Hereby know ye the Spirit of God:
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page385">[pg 385]</span><a name="Pg385" id="Pg385" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Every spirit that confesseth that Jesus Christ is come
in the flesh is of God: and every spirit that confesseth
not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is not of God:
and this is that spirit of antichrist, whereof ye have
heard that it should come; and even now already it
is in the world.”</span> 1 John 4:1-3.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
We feel like it would be justice to the reader to here
explain how we can confess that Christ is come in the
flesh, and how we can deny that he has so come. That
this does not refer to his personal coming in the flesh,
as a sacrifice for sin, is evident. But few but what
confess that Christ was here in the flesh as recorded in
the Gospels, yet many of them are not of God. Jesus
says, <span class="tei tei-q">“We will come unto him and make our abode
with him.”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“Know ye not that ye are the temple of
God?”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“For ye are the temple of God; as God hath
said, I will dwell in them, and walk in them; and I
will be their God, and they shall be my people.”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“At
that day ye shall know that I am in the Father, and
ye in me, and I in you.”</span> John 14:20. That day spoken
of is when the Holy Spirit would come and teach
them all things. That was at Pentecost. Then they
knew that Christ was in them. This then is Christ
come in the flesh.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Now it is not every one either that confesses by the
word of mouth that Christ dwells in them that are of
God. A Scriptural confession is not by word only, but
by the deed, or life. Every one who confesses by their
life that Christ is come in the flesh or dwells in them
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page386">[pg 386]</span><a name="Pg386" id="Pg386" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
must and will abide in the whole doctrine of Christ,
and live just as he lived. Such a one is of God, and
is a light even as Christ was a light. Whoever rejects
any of the Savior's doctrine, and does not, and will
not, experience and practise it in his life, the same is
an antichrist, however much he may profess to be of
God. Try all doctrines and spirits by the doctrine of
Christ, is the infallible rule.

<h3 class="tei tei-head" style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 2.40em; margin-top: 2.40em"><span style="font-size: 120%">The Prophecy Of Paul.</span></h3>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“For I know this, that after my departing shall
grievous wolves enter in among you, not sparing the
flock. Also of your own selves shall men arise, speaking
perverse things to draw away disciples after them.
Therefore watch, and remember, that by the space of
three years I ceased not to warn every one night and
day with tears.”</span> Acts 20:29-31. Paul saw the awful
apostasy from the simple faith of Christ arising. The
shadows of the dark noonday were slowly and surely
creeping on. He beholds it with tears. This was not
really some heathenish foreign power, but he says it
should be men of their own selves arising, speaking
perverse things. He saw that the leaders and overseers
of the flock (see ver. 28) would become greedy of worldly
gain, contentious, followers after pride, filled with
envy, loving preeminence, speaking things contrary to
the doctrine of Christ. It had begun to work already
in his day. <span class="tei tei-q">“The mystery of iniquity doth already
work.”</span> 2 Thes. 2:7.
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page387">[pg 387]</span><a name="Pg387" id="Pg387" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
John says these false prophets <span class="tei tei-q">“even now already
are in the world.”</span> Even before the apostles had
closed their labors they saw this dark power working.
Year after year, decade after decade, it developed
and grew. Star after star had fallen until by the
middle of the third century there was <span class="tei tei-q">“scarcely left a
luminary of godliness in existence.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Paul seeing the great crisis coming, is in fear. <span class="tei tei-q">“But
I fear, lest by any means, as the serpent beguiled Eve
through his subtilty, so your minds should be corrupted
from the simplicity that is in Jesus. For if
he that cometh preacheth another Jesus, whom we
have not preached, or if ye receive another spirit,
which ye have not received, or another gospel, which
ye have not accepted, ye might well bear with me....
For such are false apostles, deceitful workers, transforming
themselves into the apostles of Christ. And
no marvel; for Satan himself is transformed into an
angel of light. Therefore it is no great thing if his
ministers also be transformed as the ministers of righteousness;
whose end shall be according to their
works.”</span> 2 Cor. 11:3, 4, 13-15. Thus Paul gives warning
to the Corinthians of false apostles and deceitful
workers. All of this certainly is not without meaning.
He foresees great danger. He earnestly exhorts the
Thessalonian brethren to be not soon shaken, saying:
<span class="tei tei-q">“Let no man deceive you by any means: for that day
shall not come, except there come a falling away first,
and that man of sin be revealed, the son of perdition;
who opposeth and exalteth himself above all that
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page388">[pg 388]</span><a name="Pg388" id="Pg388" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
is called God, or that is worshiped; so that he as God
sitteth in the temple of God, showing himself that he
is God. Remember ye not, that, when I was yet with
you, I told you these things? And now ye know what
withholdeth that he might be revealed in his time.
For the mystery of iniquity doth already work: only
he who now letteth will let until he be taken out of the
way. And then shall that wicked be revealed, whom
the Lord shall consume with the spirit of his mouth,
and shall destroy with the brightness of his coming:
even him, whose coming is after the workings of Satan
with all power and signs and lying wonders.”</span> 2 Thes. 2:3-9.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This is indeed a wonderful and an awful prophecy.
Surely a dark image or power called a <span class="tei tei-q">“man of sin”</span>
and <span class="tei tei-q">“son of perdition”</span> shall arise and eclipse the
sun (Christ) and the moon (the church) and cause
the stars (the holy ministry) to fall. <span class="tei tei-q">“There shall
come a falling away first.”</span> This has direct reference
to the corruption of God's professed people led by an
exalted, selfish, greedy and blinded ministry. <span class="tei tei-q">“The
falling away”</span> is translated from the Greek
<span lang="el" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="el"><span style="font-style: italic">apostasia</span></span>,
and means a departure. Lexicographers define the
word as meaning <span class="tei tei-q">“an abandonment of what one has
professed.”</span> In this text it means an abandonment
of the true principles and doctrines of Christianity.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
That <span class="tei tei-q">“man of sin,”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“son of perdition,”</span> or, as in
Rotherham's translation, <span class="tei tei-q">“man of lawlessness,”</span> and
<span class="tei tei-q">“son of destruction,”</span> is what arose and obscured the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page389">[pg 389]</span><a name="Pg389" id="Pg389" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
sunlight. This epithet is given to Judas Iscariot, the
betrayer of Christ, in John 17:12, this <span class="tei tei-q">“man of
sin”</span> is a betrayer of Christ and his pure doctrine.
This <span class="tei tei-q">“man of lawlessness,”</span> no doubt, has reference
directly to the pope of Rome as the prime factor in
the apostasy; but in its broadest sense it includes the
whole of the beast religion, both Romanism and Protestantism.
This <span class="tei tei-q">“man of sin”</span> is a manism, or a power
under the government of man, and is identical with
the beast power of Rev. 13. This <span class="tei tei-q">“son of destruction”</span>
<span class="tei tei-q">“opposeth and exalteth himself above all that is called
God.”</span> He opposes or denies, and perverts the doctrines
of God that are not congenial to his desires.
He denies in a measure the divine authority, and
forms creeds and laws for the government of God's
people, thus arrogating to himself what properly belongs
to God. They take upon themselves such titles
as <span class="tei tei-q">“Father,”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“Holy Father,”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“Vicegerent of the Son
of God,”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“Doctor of Divinity,”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“Reverend,”</span> etc.
These are titles or distinctions belonging to God only.
<span class="tei tei-q">“Call no man your Father,”</span> is the command of Jesus;
and, <span class="tei tei-q">“Be ye not called Rabbi.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Vicegerent is one acting in the place of another.
The pope's claim was that God had ceased to reign
and had delegated all power unto himself—the power
to forgive sins and to grant indulgences. An indulgence
is an act of the Roman pontiff, wherein men by
making certain vows and paying certain sums of money
receive pardon of their sins. By the payment of
certain amounts they can commit most any crime and
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page390">[pg 390]</span><a name="Pg390" id="Pg390" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
their purchased indulgence absolves them from guilt.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Following this we will give a few of the secret instructions
of the Jesuits as revealed by Z. T. Griffin:
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“A Christian (Romanist) may deliberately discard
his Christian character and act like other men in those
things which are not properly Christian. By the command
of God it is lawful to murder the innocent, to
rob and commit all lewdness because he is Lord of all
things, and thus to fulfil his mandate is our duty.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“It is lawful to kill an accuser whose testimony may
jeopardize our life and honor.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“If an adulterous priest, aware of his danger, having
visited an adulteress is assailed by her husband,
kills the man in his own defense, he is not a criminal.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Papist children may accuse their parents of heresy,
although they know their parents will be burned.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“A priest may kill those who hinder him from taking
possession of any ecclesiastical office.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Servants may secretly steal from their masters as
much as they judge their labor is worth more than
the wages which they receive.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“A woman may take her husband's property to supply
her spiritual wants and to act like other women.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“A witness is not bound to declare the truth before
a lawful judge, if his deposition will injure himself
or his posterity, or if he be a priest; for a priest
can not be forced to testify before a secular judge.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Priests may kill the laity to preserve their goods,
etc.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Such appears extremely shocking to a man of integrity
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page392">[pg 392]</span><a name="Pg392" id="Pg392" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
and principle. Such laws and tolerations and
the direct sale of indulgences brings a blush of shame
to a moral man, and much more to the Christian.
The sale of indulgences is not true of Romanism
only. Throughout the realms of Protestantism there
is a shameful sale of these indulgences in an indirect
way. Wicked and designing men are tolerated and
fellowshiped by the sect ministry because of their
liberality to the church. It is true it matters not if
a man does occasionally get drunk, or if he does defraud
his neighbor, or commit adultery, abuse his
wife, attend theaters, and such like sins, if he is a
liberal contributor to their treasury, he is smiled at,
welcomed and encouraged to be faithful.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
While in the papacy we find such titles as <span class="tei tei-q">“Holy
Father,”</span> etc., in Protestantism we find the <span class="tei tei-q">“D. D.”</span>
and <span class="tei tei-q">“LL. D.”</span> and <span class="tei tei-q">“Reverend.”</span> They who assume
such honorary titles set themselves up to be equal with
God. The word <span class="tei tei-q">“reverend”</span> is from the Hebrew
<span class="tei tei-q">“<span lang="he" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="he"><span style="font-style: italic">yare</span></span>,”</span> and means <span class="tei tei-q">“to be feared.”</span>
So man is thus setting himself up as one to be feared, when the Word
of the Lord tells us to <span class="tei tei-q">“fear not man, but fear God.”</span>
<span class="tei tei-q">“Holy and reverend is his name.”</span> God alone is to
be revered, and for man to prefix such a title to his
name is to sit as God the temple of God.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Popes and bishops are found in the councils and
conferences framing laws and passing resolutions for
the government of their membership and for the qualifications
of a minister, like as if God had ceased to
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page393">[pg 393]</span><a name="Pg393" id="Pg393" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
reign and there was no Bible and they alone were
invested with power to govern and control the kingdom
of heaven. The qualifications of a minister in
some of the popular denominations of to-day are a
certain number of years in school and a certain number
of histories and commentaries mastered. The
qualifications as given by Paul are almost wholly
ignored. The profession of the ministry in the sect
world has been dragged down to a level with the professions
of the world. A young man decides to be a
physician. He goes to school and learns his profession.
He receives his diploma, comes out and practises
what he was taught at school, and makes his
living thereby. Another young man decides to be
a lawyer. He studies for that profession, is admitted
to the bar, practises, and makes his living thereby.
Another young man decides to be a preacher. He
goes to school and learns his profession. He is licensed,
comes out and preaches, and makes his living
thereby.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“For the mystery of iniquity doth already work.”</span>
This is the spirit of antichrist, of which John says,
<span class="tei tei-q">“even now already is it in the world.”</span> This antichrist,
apostate spirit is a mystery. It contains a
hidden mysterious power that has blinded and deceived
millions of souls. Even in Paul's time it began
its hidden mysterious working. The Roman
Catholic sect arose and met this description of the
<span class="tei tei-q">“man of sin”</span> as given by Paul. The Waldenses in
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page394">[pg 394]</span><a name="Pg394" id="Pg394" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the thirteenth century looked upon the church at
Rome as the <span class="tei tei-q">“whore of Babylon,”</span> and the <span class="tei tei-q">“man of
sin.”</span> Those blinded by the mysterious, delusive spirit
of iniquity considered such language against the
<span class="tei tei-q">“holy church”</span> as blaspheming against God. Protestantism
to-day with its great bishops and reverends
and D. D.'s and creeds and systems, forms and ceremonies,
almost as perfectly meets the description of the
<span class="tei tei-q">“man of sin”</span> as does the Roman hierarchy. The
same hidden mysterious delusive spirit has so intoxicated
its subjects that they consider such speech as
blasphemy.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This <span class="tei tei-q">“man of sin”</span> is described as coming with signs
and lying wonders. The lying wonders of this dark
reign of the <span class="tei tei-q">“son of perdition”</span> are almost innumerable.
It is said that a milkwhite dove descended from
heaven with a phial of oil at the baptism of Cloris.

A Sicilian hermit had a revelation from heaven in
which was revealed that the prayers of the monks

A woman named Julian pretended she had a revelation
from God in which it was disclosed to her to be
the will of God that a peculiar festival should be held
annually in honor of the real presence of Christ in
the holy sacrament. She said that as often as she
addressed herself to God or to the saints in prayer
she saw a full moon with a small defect, and the spirit
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page395">[pg 395]</span><a name="Pg395" id="Pg395" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
informed her that this defect was the want of this
annual festival. This festival was established by
Clement V in 1311 A.D.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The fables of the removal of the chapel of Loretto,
the wandering Jew, the visions of Stockius and Sims,
and St. Anthony's obliging an ass to adore the sacrament
as related by Mosheim, are astonishing lying
wonders and ridiculous inventions. The Protestant
daughters of mystic Babylon are not free from lying
wonders to this present day. The book of Mormon
contains fabulous stories; the spiritualists' work is
freighted with many satanic wonders, and frequently
we hear of visions and revelations that when tried by
the immutable Word of God are proven to be lying
wonders. Our God is able to perform wonders, and of
a truth, wonderful are his doings at this present time,
but all that he does is in decency and in order, and
contains nothing of the fabulous.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Paul says, <span class="tei tei-q">“Now the Spirit speaketh expressly,
that in the latter times some shall depart from the
faith, giving heed to seducing spirits, and doctrines
of devils; speaking lies in hypocrisy; having their
conscience seared with a hot iron; forbidding to
marry, and commanding to abstain from meats.”</span>
1 Tim. 4:1-3. You will only have to read the history
of the Roman Catholic sect, of its fabulous inventions,
of its awful tyranny, its superstitions, its rites,
and ceremonies, to find the fulfilment of this prophecy.
It is extremely astonishing that men of intelligence
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page396">[pg 396]</span><a name="Pg396" id="Pg396" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
would be the supporters of such a dark institution.
It only shows the seductive power of demon
spirits. The doctrines of devils that have been originated
both in Romanism and Protestantism are almost
without number, some of which we will speak of in
our next chapter. The hypocritical lies that have been
invented and the persecutions and contentions and
quarrelings and fightings against one another can only
be carried on by men whose conscience is seared by
a hot iron. The Catholics abstain from eating meat
on certain days and at certain times. A certain law
sect, called the Seventh Day Adventist, teaches abstinence
from pork. The papists forbid the marriage
of the clergy. Neither is this unscriptural prohibition
confined to the papacy alone, but some of her
harlot daughters have patterned after her, and even
gone beyond her in this respect.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In the time of this apostasy it is said by the apostle
that <span class="tei tei-q">“they will not endure sound doctrine; but
after their own lusts shall they heap to themselves
teachers, having itching ears; and they shall turn
away their ears from the truth, and shall be turned
unto fables.”</span> 2 Tim. 4:3, 4. Where shall we look for
a fulfilment of this prophecy? Who does not know
that we have now come to that time? The sound doctrine
which if obeyed will make men a light in the
world is not endorsed in the circle of the papacy,
neither in the Protestant denominations. To-day the
generality of mankind, even in professed Christianity,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page397">[pg 397]</span><a name="Pg397" id="Pg397" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
do not care to hear the practical truths of the
gospel as we have recorded in part first of this work.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Theories and speculative opinions have taken the
place of sound doctrine in the Protestant pulpit of
this present day. The congregations in general have
become so proud and vain in their imaginations,
and so spoiled through philosophy, that they heap to
themselves teachers having the wildest speculative
opinions. Their itching ears have an insatiable desire
for fine essays, amusing stories, and historic tales.
The proud, arrogant pulpit orator of this present
day makes it a study how best to calm the fears,
gild the sins, and strew with flowers the iniquitous
path of his passionate congregation.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Protestantism presents a most deplorable picture
to those who have escaped her ruinous walls. Many a
bishop and lord is bewailing his sad spiritless, powerless
state, and crying, <span class="tei tei-q">“Whither are we drifting?”</span>
Where will you have to go to-day but to Protestantism
to find a fulfilment of Paul's prophecy in 2 Tim.
3:1-5? <span class="tei tei-q">“This know also, that in the last days perilous
times shall come. For men shall be lovers of
their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers,
disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy, without
natural affection, truce-breakers, false accusers,
incontinent, fierce, despisers of those that are good,
traitors, heady, high-minded, lovers of pleasure more
than lovers of God; having a form of godliness, but
denying the power thereof: from such turn away.”</span>
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page398">[pg 398]</span><a name="Pg398" id="Pg398" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Paul here speaks of a religious people. They have
<span class="tei tei-q">“a form of godliness.”</span> While the <span class="tei tei-q">“last days”</span> and
<span class="tei tei-q">“last time”</span> often include the whole of this gospel
day, yet this prophecy particularly relates to the
nearing of the end of time. Jesus says, <span class="tei tei-q">“As the days
of Noe were, so shall also the coming of the Son of
man be. For as in the days that were before the
flood they were eating and drinking, marrying and
giving in marriage, until the day that Noe entered
into the ark.”</span> Mat. 24:37, 38. Let us considerately
review this prophecy.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Lovers of their own selves.”</span> Such a disposition of
heart will manifest itself. Such people have more
concern for their own welfare than for their neighbor's.
They will look out for their own best interest.
In the ministry it would be manifested in
seeking places of ease, luxury, honor, and wealth.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Covetous.”</span> A desire for worldly gain, loving
money. By their conversation and general manner
they manifest a strong desire for wealth, resorting
to festivals and fairs to gain money.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Boasters.”</span> Placing a high estimate on their own
personal worth and accomplishments. As a man recently
remarked of a stained window in a meeting-house:
<span class="tei tei-q">“See that window! Is not that fine? That cost
one hundred dollars. That is my window, I put that
in. These others only cost seventy-five dollars. See,
here are my initials.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Proud.”</span> Studying to make a fine appearance,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page399">[pg 399]</span><a name="Pg399" id="Pg399" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
striving to excel in pulpit oratory, advertising the
work they have done—so many have been converted
through my labors, etc. All these works are indications
of a proud heart.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Blasphemers.”</span> To speak lightly of sacred things,
to ridicule any portion of God's Word. Many professors
of Christianity of to-day when asked if they
believe in the ordinance of feet-washing will make
some such answer as, <span class="tei tei-q">“If your feet are dirty, you
ought to wash them.”</span> The doctrines of holiness and
divine healing are often impiously spoken of. Jesus
Christ is sometimes charged with being a freemason,
and recently a man said that the Savior went to
school and studied for the ministry.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Disobedient to parents.”</span> Is there not many a
young lady and young man in apostate Protestantism,
trampling under their feet the commands and wishes
of their parents? The <span class="tei tei-q">“old man,”</span> or the <span class="tei tei-q">“old
woman”</span> (as they often speak of their parents), they
say, <span class="tei tei-q">“is not going to rule me.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Unthankful.”</span> Murmuring when reverses come;
complaining if their financial undertakings are unsuccessful;
dissatisfied and discontented. These are
evidences of an unthankful and ungrateful heart.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Unholy.”</span> Those who dispute the doctrine of
holiness, of purity or sinless perfection. They confess
that they commit sin, and their life bears evidence
that their confession is true. Or should they profess
holiness and yet not live a true holy life they
are classed with the great dark apostasy.
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page400">[pg 400]</span><a name="Pg400" id="Pg400" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Without natural affection.”</span> Many times the love
of self, the love of pleasure, the love of the world,
and sin in general destroys the natural affection.
Mothers in their heart regret their children were
born, because it prevents their entering society as they
would like. They bewail the state of pregnancy for
the same reason, and resort to murderous means for
the privilege of enjoying more of the pleasures of
sin and the world. Children also often betray a
great lack of natural affection by their treatment of
parents and one another.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Truce-breakers.”</span> Having but little regard for a
promise or obligation; violating obligations and promises
to God and to man.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“False accusers.”</span> Slandering those who do live
and obey the whole Word of God.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Incontinent.”</span> Those who are living in the lust of
the flesh; controlled by a depraved appetite.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Fierce.”</span> Getting angry and becoming quarrelsome;
all that is the opposite of gentleness and kindness.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Despisers of those that are good.”</span> Because a man
lives a good, pure, consistent Christian life it puts
a rebuke upon the hypocrite, and for this reason he
despises the good man.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Traitors.”</span> Actually denying and renouncing portions
of the Holy Bible, which they profess to believe.
They are traitors to God and to Christianity.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Heady.”</span> They are unteachable. No matter what
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page401">[pg 401]</span><a name="Pg401" id="Pg401" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the Bible says, they know they are all right if they
do indulge in things that are wrong.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“High-minded.”</span> So lifted up in themselves that
the humble doctrines of the Savior are beneath their
observance. These humble truths of the Bible are
considered as nonessentials by the heady and high-minded.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God.”</span>
Take more real comfort and delight in the party or
festival than they do in worship. A sermon of thirty
minutes is about as long as they can endure. Reading
the Bible is an unpleasant task, therefore the
good old book lies unused; but they can spend hours in
the place of revelry.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Where do we have to look for such doings and
characters as we have described? They abound in
great numbers in the various denominations of to-day.
Adam Clarke in his commentary in speaking of this
prophecy, says: <span class="tei tei-q">“This description the papists apply
to the Protestants. The Protestants in their turn apply
it to the papists. There have been both teachers
and people in every age of the church and world to
whom these words may be most legitimately applied.
Both Catholics and Protestants have been lovers of
their own selves,”</span> etc., <span class="tei tei-q">“having a form of godliness,
but denying the power thereof.”</span> How often the
sectish lords lament the deadness of their congregations,
and also grow weary of their own spiritless,
formal prayers and sermons.

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page402">[pg 402]</span><a name="Pg402" id="Pg402" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Bishop Weaver of the United Brethren denomination
uses the following language, as quoted by a holiness
periodical:
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Power Versus Form.</span></span></span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“The pulpit ought to be a center of power. But
is it? God said to Jonah, <span class="tei tei-q">‘Preach the preaching I
bid thee.’</span> Jesus said, <span class="tei tei-q">‘Preach the gospel.’</span> Paul said,
<span class="tei tei-q">‘Preach the Word.’</span> Again he said, <span class="tei tei-q">‘We preach
Christ.’</span> Philip <span class="tei tei-q">‘preached Jesus.’</span> All this means the
selfsame thing. Christ is the soul of the gospel as well
as the substance of all doctrine. Much of the preaching,
reading or talking—whatever you please to call
it—is Christless and powerless. Of course, this is a
refined age, and the people are away up, but the
devil can appear as refined as a saint. Nothing suits
him better than to get the preacher away from the gospel
on to some fine topic and then get some one to tell
him (the preacher) that he made a fine effort. The
pulpit should proclaim the great, fundamental doctrines
of the Bible. But does it? The people are
often treated to a well-written essay or dissertation
on some abstract question that does not contain an
ounce of pure gospel. There is neither lightning nor
thunder in it. One reason why Paul was not ashamed
of the gospel of Christ was because it was the power
of God unto salvation. But it was no more the
power of God unto salvation then than it is now.
It is the same eternal truth, yesterday, to-day, and
forever.</span>
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page403">[pg 403]</span><a name="Pg403" id="Pg403" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“In Hosea we read, <span class="tei tei-q">‘Like people, like priest.’</span> In
Isaiah we read, <span class="tei tei-q">‘As with the people, so with the priest.’</span>
There is a great deal of harmony between the pulpit
and the pew. Everything goes along in an orderly
manner. All services must be short or the people can
not stand them—short prayers, short sermons, short
everything. Oftentimes the service is gone through
with, and nothing in it but an out-and-out performance;
no life, no spirit, no power. Protestants often
speak disparagingly of the ritualistic services gone
through with by the Roman Catholic church, but if
you come right down to it you will find about as
much spirit and power in the one as the other. The
result is that scores and hundreds of men, and women,
and children are being gathered into the Protestant
church who have not an ounce of Christian experience.
If reformation was necessary in the times of Luther
and Wesley in Europe, and Otterbein and Asbury in
America, it is scarcely less necessary now. But some
one may say this is putting it too strong. What are
the facts? Is it not a fact that the church is drifting
away from the more spiritual to the social and intellectual?
If the religion of Jesus Christ is what the
Bible represents it to be, then the church in general
is far below the standard. Where is the spiritual
power that was breathed into the apostolic church?
Peter's sermon on the day of Pentecost was not what
the people of to-day would call brilliant, but the
people were pricked, not in the head, but in the
heart.</span>

<span class="tei tei-q">“What did it? Two things. First, he preached the
gospel straight. Second, the Holy Spirit quickened
the Word spoken and made it powerful. What would
the people do if there should be such an uproar in some
of our congregations to-day? It would scare some of
them half to death, and many would run for dear life.
But we have the same gospel Peter had, and the same
Holy Spirit to accompany the Word. What is the
matter? The people do not want it that way, neither
does the devil. Thousands of church people instead of
praying for the baptism of the Holy Spirit, are asking
such questions as these: Is it wrong for a Christian to
dance? to go to the theater? to visit places of amusement?
to play progressive euchre? etc. Why don't
they ask such questions as these: Is it wrong to pray?
to go to church? to take the sacrament? etc. The fact
is, a man or woman filled with the Spirit of Christ
knows without asking any questions whether a thing is
right or wrong.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“But some may say that the writer is getting old
and feeble, and has fallen far behind in the race, all
of which is readily granted; but the fact remains that
we have the same gospel, which is as changeless as the
throne of God. If in the days of the Son of man and
his inspired apostles it was necessary that a man
should be <span class="tei tei-q">‘born again,’</span> <span class="tei tei-q">‘born of the Spirit,’</span> <span class="tei tei-q">‘made a
new creature,’</span> and be <span class="tei tei-q">‘cleansed from all sin,’</span> it is
necessary now. If there ever was a time when men
were born into the kingdom of grace by the power of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page405">[pg 405]</span><a name="Pg405" id="Pg405" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the Holy Ghost, it remains the same to-day. What
under the heavens is the use for preachers and people
to go whining around, and winking at this and that
when they know it is out of harmony with the plain
teaching of God's Word? It is all well enough to be
nice and orderly in the house of God, but there is no
substitute for the power of the Holy Spirit. Jesus
Christ is the advocate between God and man, and the
Holy Spirit is the executive officer in the holy trinity.
If the church with its splendid machinery were endued
with power as it might and ought to be, there is no
telling what might be done in the next ten years. But
what good is all this machinery, with no power to run
it? What good is an engine without steam? I saw
Engine 999. It was beautiful to look at. Everything
was as near perfect as it could well be. But it was
standing stock-still. Why? There was no steam; no
power to move a wheel. That represents a good many
congregations. The machinery is there, but no power
to run it. In Ezekiel's vision he saw a marvelous vehicle,
which moved with great rapidity. But it did
not move itself. The spirit of the living creature was
in the wheels; but for that it would not have moved at
all. So it is with the church. If the Spirit of the living
God is not in it, it will not and can not move forward.
Oh, this spiritless, powerless performance called worship.
How it detracts from the usefulness of the
church!”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Such a description as given by Paul in the above
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page406">[pg 406]</span><a name="Pg406" id="Pg406" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
prophecy, and by this bishop, is true of sect Babylon
of to-day. Such graceless, spiritless, Christless institutions
are dark enough to obscure the beautiful light
of the gospel.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Christian Advocate</span></span>, the organ of Methodism,
a few years ago said: <span class="tei tei-q">“We are approaching a crisis in
church life. Gradually, but surely, disregard for the
Bible, for the Sabbath, for the church, and for God,
is taking possession of Christians. Teachers whose
reputation for scholarship gives them wide influence,
give it as their opinion that the Bible is not inspired
at all, except as other great books are inspired. This
poison has penetrated all our churches. The virus
of skepticism has entered the pulpits in our own denomination.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Who can take issue with this editor? We very
heartily agree with him. If any one is disposed to
doubt that the virus of skepticism has entered the
Methodist pulpits, he will only have to read the account
of the meeting of four hundred of the leading
ministers of New York and vicinity, including Bishop
Edward G. Andrews. Below we give an account of
the meeting as published in the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Atlanta Journal</span></span>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Methodist Ministers Question The Bible.</span></span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
At a meeting of Methodist ministers last Monday
morning in New York City, the validity of many of
the stories of the Bible was questioned. Rev. S. P
Cadman urged at that meeting that the Bible could
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page407">[pg 407]</span><a name="Pg407" id="Pg407" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
not be accepted as the sole rule of faith any longer.
He pointed out alleged discrepancies in it, and said
people could find truth only at its fountain head,
Christ. The other ministers applauded him.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“That the inerrancy and infallibility of the Bible
are no longer possible of belief among reasonable
men.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This proposition, the acceptance of which will tear
away the fundamental pillar of Methodist theology,
was urged in all force, sincerity, and enthusiasm by
the Rev. Cadman, pastor of the Metropolitan Temple,
before the regular weekly meeting of the Methodist
ministers of New York.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Four hundred of the leading ministers of New
York and its vicinity, including Bishop Edward G.
Andrews, were present when Mr. Cadman's paper was
read. He was applauded when he arose to read it,
and applauded again when he got through.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Mr. Cadman's paper was one of a series on Bible
criticism. A paper taking practically the same
ground was read before the ministers on the Monday
evening before last, another paper on the subject will
be read next Monday.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This bold portentous utterance, involving the most
radical departure from accepted tenets of the Methodist
church since its very foundation, was made before
the most representative body of Methodist clergy in
America. It included the vast majority of the preachers
of Greater New York. It is the first announcement
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page408">[pg 408]</span><a name="Pg408" id="Pg408" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of an impending controversy, which may shake
the Methodist church to its very foundation stones.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The acceptance of Dr. Cadman's proposition, heard
with respect and applause by the New York ministers,
is comparable to the adoption of a new constitution
for the United States. It places the Bible on the
basis of historical works on other than divine subjects;
it rejects the authenticity of all parts of Holy Scripture
which are repugnant to human reason.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">

find fault with are:

clipping from the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">New York Herald</span></span> of recent date.
It needs no comment, and explains the lack of spiritual
power in the M. E. church of to-day. The attitude
of the listening ministers and bishop, and their
approval (of a majority at least) of the sentiments expressed
by the speaker and indicated by the applause
shows the extent to which this so-called liberal element
has permeated the M. E. church. This man is
the leader of the so-called forward movement of the
M. E. church in New York City, a movement consisting
of short popular sermons, pleasant hours, Sunday
evening concerts, lectures, united choir, and the
innumerable fandangoes to entertain the people and
keep the church crowded.</span>

ditch of eternal night by these blind, reason-exalting
leaders—cry out, <span class="tei tei-q">‘How long, O Lord, how long,’</span> must
the followers of the life of Jesus Christ endure these
things and by their silence be charged (by implication)
with endorsing the present condition of things and
methods of church work?”</span>

We are often told by those who know no better, that
this world is becoming more Christianized. The Bible
says, <span class="tei tei-q">“But evil men and seducers shall wax worse
and worse, deceiving, and being deceived.”</span> 2 Tim. 3:13.
People are more advanced in invention and education
than in former years, we frankly admit. There
are not the inhuman wars and barbarous massacres
and bloody persecutions that once were, and by hasty
external view of political governments and educational
interest one may conclude that the world is
growing better. But where matters are growing
worse and things becoming more deceivable is to be
found in <span class="tei tei-q">“mystery Babylon the great”</span> and her harlot
daughters; namely, Catholicism and the Protestant
sects. They are becoming more worldly and covetous,
more proud and popularity-loving. They are
denying much of the Bible, turning their meeting-houses
into concert halls and opera-houses. In a
village where we resided until recently the Methodist
meeting-house was called by the community in general
the Methodist theater.

The paper by Mr. Cadman as quoted above is a
specimen of how they deny the Bible. They almost
unanimously deny the unity of the Bible, divine healing,
holiness and some of the ordinances. But in the
decade to come you will see much more astonishing
things. The sectarian world is now just setting
sail upon such a sea of revelry, banqueting, money
getting, lewdness, and idolatry, as we have not seen
before. Her awful sins will reach unto heaven, yea,
for some years past have been crying out against her,
but each year growing worse. Where is the aged man
or woman but who remembers the day when Methodists
had a plain, unassuming, consecrated ministry?
The laity went plainly and modestly dressed. They
had real Holy Ghost revivals, but those days are
gone. To-day she is intoxicated with the spirit of
worldliness. Every effort is being put forth, every
nerve strained, the power and energy of intellect used
to dazzle the world by oratory, and pompous show.
O God, as we behold the awful sins of sectarianism
we feel in our soul like Jeremiah when he wrote his
Lamentation.

you, who privily shall bring in damnable heresies,
even denying the Lord that bought them, and bring
upon themselves swift destruction. And many shall
follow their pernicious ways; by reason of whom the
way of truth shall be evil spoken of. And through
covetousness shall they with feigned words make merchandise

2 Pet. 2:1-3.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Here the inspired apostle foretells the coming of
false teachers, who shall bring in damnable heresies.
Heresy is translated from the Greek word
<span lang="el" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="el"><span style="font-style: italic">hairesis</span></span>.
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page413">[pg 413]</span><a name="Pg413" id="Pg413" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
The word <span class="tei tei-q">“sect”</span> is translated from the same Greek
word. The word <span class="tei tei-q">“damnable”</span> is from the Greek
<span lang="el" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="el"><span style="font-style: italic">apoleia</span></span>, and means destruction. So the
rendering of Rotherham, <span class="tei tei-q">“parties of destruction,”</span> and of the
German, <span class="tei tei-q">“destructive sects,”</span> corresponds with the
original. Protestant teachers will readily tell you
that these <span class="tei tei-q">“false teachers”</span> and <span class="tei tei-q">“destructive sects”</span>
refer to the heresies that sprang up in the first few
centuries of this Christian era. We admit that sects
and parties arose in those primitive days. We see
something of this spirit in 1 Cor. 3:1-5.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But are sects damnable in one age of the world and
commendable in another? We conclude that if partyism,
sectarianism, schisms, divisions, and heresies were
destructive and brought destruction upon their adherents
in the first centuries, it will do likewise in the
last centuries. Paul says, <span class="tei tei-q">“I beseech you, brethren,
by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that you all
speak the same thing, and that there be no divisions
[schisms, margin] among you; but that ye be perfectly
joined together in the same mind and in the same
judgment.”</span> 1 Cor. 1:10.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Many shall follow in the pernicious ways of these
heresies. Is not this true at this present time? By
them the way of truth shall be evil spoken of. There
is scarcely a sectarian in the universe but will speak
evil of some portion of the truth. These false teachers
shall with feigned words make merchandise of
their followers, because of their covetousness. This
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page414">[pg 414]</span><a name="Pg414" id="Pg414" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
is really more true of present day sectarian preachers
than it was of the false teachers in the first
centuries. Does not the ministry of the present day
resort to the telling of amusing stories, and touching
incidents, and fabulous tales to amuse and allure the
people, and are they not making merchandise of them?
Are they not receiving large salaries? And no matter
how poor you may be you must pay your preacher or
else you have no hearty welcome to membership.
The preacher can sit in his easy chair with folded
arms while you labor and strive for his support. He
can spend his evenings in luxury and pleasure while
you are tossing upon your bed thinking and planning
how to clothe and feed your little ones and get
money to pay your church dues; for you know full
well if you do not pay you will be snubbed and rejected
and finally cut off and made believe, if possible,
that you are on your way to hell.

The remainder of this chapter, beginning with the
twelfth verse is a vivid description of the hireling
ministry of these days. For the benefit of the reader
we will quote and number each verse and give brief
comment. 12. <span class="tei tei-q">“But these as natural brute beasts
made to be taken and destroyed, speak evil of the
things they understand not, and shall utterly perish in
their own corruption.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
They are not governed by the Bible, but as <span class="tei tei-q">“brute

the holy commandments of God, which they do not
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page415">[pg 415]</span><a name="Pg415" id="Pg415" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

13. <span class="tei tei-q">“And shall receive the reward of unrighteousness,

</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The excursions of sightseeing and pleasure, the
picnics and parties they count great pleasure. Characters
that engage in such revelry and worldliness
are spots and blemishes to Christianity. We are
commanded to keep ourselves unspotted from the
world. <span class="tei tei-q">“Sporting themselves with their own deceivings
while they feast with you.”</span> They will teach
their young members that it is no harm to go to the
party, to attend the shows and fairs, the suppers and
entertainments, to play cards for amusement, and
many like things; and with their own deceivings they
will feast with them in such sports.

14. <span class="tei tei-q">“Having eyes full of adultery, and that can not
cease from sin; beguiling unstable souls: a heart they
have exercised with covetous practises; cursed children.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Their hearts are inclined to evil ways and filled
with fleshly desires; loving the things of the world
and often confessing, <span class="tei tei-q">“We can not live in this world
without committing sin.”</span> By their evil example and
false teachings they are beguiling many unstable
souls. Their covetous heart is scarcely ever satisfied.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The prophet Isaiah speaks of these prophets saying,
<span class="tei tei-q">“They are all ignorant, they are all dumb dogs, they
can not bark; sleeping, lying down, loving to slumber.
Yea, they are greedy dogs which can never have
enough.”</span> Isa. 56:10, 11. This is a lazy, ease-loving
greedy ministry. If they are getting $500.00 a year
they will want $600.00. If they are receiving $1,000.00
they will want $1,200.00, and go wherever they can
get the most. <span class="tei tei-q">“Cursed children.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
15. <span class="tei tei-q">“Which have forsaken the right way, and are
gone astray, following the way of Balaam the son
of Bosor, who loved the wages of unrighteousness.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
These false teachers have known a better way. The
Lord showed Balaam the right way, but he was seduced
by the reward offered by Balak. So with these
teachers; they once knew a more righteous way, but
have turned aside for the wages of unrighteousness.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
16. <span class="tei tei-q">“But was rebuked for his iniquity: the dumb
ass speaking with man's voice forbad the madness
of the prophet.”</span> As Balaam was rebuked by the
dumb ass, so these false teachers in their madness
for worldly honor, gain and wisdom are rebuked by
the humble ignorant Christians, whom they consider
as dumb ignorant creatures.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
17. <span class="tei tei-q">“These are wells without water, clouds that
are carried with a tempest; to whom the mist of
darkness is reserved forever.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Salvation is often spoken of as the <span class="tei tei-q">“water of life.”</span>
These false teachers are wells without water. Their
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page417">[pg 417]</span><a name="Pg417" id="Pg417" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
preaching does not feed and water their flock. Their
empty forms and stale essays contain no spiritual
food. For this reason there is a famine throughout
Babylon. <span class="tei tei-q">“Behold, the days come, saith the Lord
God, that I will send a famine in the land, not a famine
of bread, nor a thirst for water, but of hearing
the words of the Lord.”</span> Amos 8:11. From the pulpit
we hear lectures, stories, and history, and not
the pure gospel; this is the cause of this famine.
<span class="tei tei-q">“Clouds they are carried with a tempest.”</span> When
there is some appearance of rain or water from these
teachers, and you have hopes of hearing some of the
Word of God, behold some false wind of doctrine for
personal advantage carries away every sign of rain.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
18. <span class="tei tei-q">“For when they speak great swelling words
of vanity, they allure through the lust of the flesh,
through much wantonness, those that were clean escaped
from them who live in error.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
They preach in sublime style, and speak great words
of vanity, almost incomprehensible to common people,
and by touching incidents and sympathetic stories
they allure, and those who were really converted are
often led into error and formalism by these vain
teachers.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
19. <span class="tei tei-q">“While they promise them liberty, they themselves
are the servants of corruption.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
From the pulpit they speak in elegant, flowery
language of Jesus and heaven, and give great promises
of blessings to their hearers, while they themselves
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page418">[pg 418]</span><a name="Pg418" id="Pg418" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
are walking in sin and under bondage to the
flesh.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It is not difficult for all who are not entombed in
the mystic fogs of Babylon delusion to locate the
fulfilment of this prophecy. Were Peter living today
and should look over the Catholic and Protestant
ministry he could not pen a better description of
them than he has here done.

they are without water, carried about of winds; trees
whose fruit withereth, without fruit, twice dead,
plucked up by the roots; raging waves of the sea,
foaming out their own shame; wandering stars, to
whom is reserved the blackness of darkness forever.”</span>

words, having men's persons in admiration because
of advantage.”</span> Ver. 16.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
We believe that comment here is unnecessary since
commenting on Peter's prophecy. In verses seventeen
and eighteen Jude tells us these are the mockers
of Christianity that should come in the last time,
who should walk after their own ungodly lust. Jude
foresees the great dark beastly manism that was to
darken the earth in the clear day, the same as was
seen by the Savior, Paul, and Peter.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
When quoting the twelfth verse the Spirit of the
Lord referred us to the wonderful prophecy of Ezekiel:
<span class="tei tei-q">“Son of man, prophesy against the shepherds of
Israel, prophesy, and say unto them, Thus saith the
Lord God unto the shepherds; Woe be to the shepherds
of Israel that do feed themselves! should not
the shepherds feed the flock? Ye eat the fat, and ye
clothe you with the wool, ye kill them that are fed;
but ye feed not the flock. The diseased have ye not
strengthened, neither have ye healed that which was
sick, neither have ye bound up that which was
broken, neither have ye brought again that which
was driven away, neither have ye sought that which
was lost; but with force and with cruelty have ye
ruled them.”</span> Ezek. 34:2-4.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
These shepherds feed and clothe themselves. They
are more concerned for their own personal gain than
for the souls of the people. If they do not receive an
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page420">[pg 420]</span><a name="Pg420" id="Pg420" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
ample salary they will leave the souls to perish.
They are unlike Paul, who labored with his own hands
for his support while he fed starving souls upon the
words of life. He was a light in the world, and the
covetous, greedy shepherds are creators of darkness.
These prophecies are all true of the present day
sectarian ministry. They are the hireling shepherds
that flee when they see the wolf coming. When poverty
comes, they flee to a place where they are better
supported. The prophecies concerning the apostasy
are more particularly against the ministry than the
laity, because the ministers are the leaders, leading
their followers on in darkness.

</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Ver. 1. <span class="tei tei-q">“And I stood upon the sand of the sea,
and saw a beast rise up out of the sea, having seven
heads and ten horns, and upon his horns ten crowns,
and upon his heads the name of blasphemy.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Beast”</span> means a fleshly, human, or mannish power.
<span class="tei tei-q">“Sea”</span> is often used to represent trouble, upheaval,
and commotions. History abounds with accounts of
the upheavals in the ecclesiastical heavens between
bishops in the third century. Out of these contentions
and strivings and confusions arose in the year 325
A.D., a beastly or mannish form of ecclesiastical government;
namely, the Roman Catholic church.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The <span class="tei tei-q">“seven heads”</span> have by some writers been interpreted
to be the seven mountains on which the
city of Rome is situated. For proof of this interpretation
they quote Rev. 17:9. How that inanimate,
literal mountains can represent heads, since the head
contains the power of intellect and authority, lies
beyond our comprehension.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
That the ten horns are the ten kingdoms spoken
of by Daniel (chap. 7, ver. 24) is, we consider, unquestionable.
Now it may be a little obscure why the
Revelator will make use of ten stately kingdoms to
represent the ten horns of an ecclesiastical government.
It is because this ecclesiastical government is
human the same as a state government; and because
the beastly Romish church was supported, and became
what they were pleased to call both church and state.
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page422">[pg 422]</span><a name="Pg422" id="Pg422" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The seven heads are seven supreme forms of government.
These seven heads are seven mountains (not
literal) and the seven mountains are seven kings.
Rev. 17:9, 10. History tells us there were seven distinct
forms of government in the Roman empire. The
first, a royal or kingly government, continued about
428 years. The second was republic in form under
the administration of dictators. This form of government
continued eighty and eight years. The third
form of government was under the absolute control
of ten magistrates called decemvirs, and are also called
prætors. The duration of this form of government
exceeded three hundred years. In the year 336 B.C.,
the third form of government came to an end by the
Latins being conquered by the Romans, and the consulate
government succeeded, which continued until
about the year 50 B.C. The fifth form of government
was under the control of three men, and therefore
called a triumvirate. The triumvirate form of
government came to an end before John's vision of
these heads. These are the five <span class="tei tei-q">“fallen ones.”</span> Rev. 17:10.
The power that then was, which was the sixth
head of the beast, was the imperial power of the
Cæsars, which continued more than four hundred
years. The seventh power was the patriciate, which
continued about fifty years.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
These are the seven heads and ten horns—the
seven forms of government, and the ten kingdoms
out of which grew the eleventh horn which Daniel
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page423">[pg 423]</span><a name="Pg423" id="Pg423" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
saw, or the beast which John saw. Thus we have the
beast with its seven heads and ten horns.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Ver. 2. <span class="tei tei-q">“And the beast which I saw was like unto a
leopard, and his feet were as the feet of a bear, and
his mouth as the mouth of a lion: and the dragon
gave him his power, and his seat, and great authority.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Sins and worldliness are termed spots by the Bible.
The leopard is a spotted beast, so no other animal
could better represent the Romish sect with its dark
spots of sin and crime. The bear makes use of the
foot to deal the deadly blow upon an enemy. The
papacy with its tyrannical feet has trodden down
all that would dare rise against it. Great thunderings
and loud roarings proceed out of the mouth of
the lion in his strength and glory. So this beast fitly
represents the Catholic church in her boasted strength,
power, and authority.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The dragon that gave this ecclesiastical beast its
authority and seat was the Roman state. In connection
with this we will consider the first three
verses of the twelfth chapter of Revelation. <span class="tei tei-q">“And
there appeared a great wonder in heaven; a woman
clothed with the sun, and the moon under her feet,
and upon her head a crown of twelve stars.”</span> Ver. 1.
The woman is the church. By believing or standing
upon the Word a soul is brought into the church by
the Spirit. Thus the church stands upon the moon
(the Word of God), clothed by the sun (the Spirit).
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page424">[pg 424]</span><a name="Pg424" id="Pg424" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
This is no disagreement with a former use we have
made of the sun and moon as symbols. An object
may be used to symbolize different things in different
prophecies.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“And there appeared another wonder in heaven;
and behold a great red dragon, having seven heads
and ten horns.”</span> Ver. 3. This dragon is the same as
the dragon that gave power to the beast of Rev. 13:2;
namely, the Roman state. The Roman empire, pagan
as it was, endeavored to devour the church as is said
of the dragon in Rev. 12:4.

We will now return to Rev. 13:3: <span class="tei tei-q">“And I saw one
of his heads as it were wounded to death; and his
deadly wound was healed: and all the world wondered
after the beast.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
As we have before observed, the seven original
heads were the seven principalities, or forms of government,
which gave rise to the Roman empire. A
head or an ecclesiastical form of government in Romanism
received a wound. The world wondered after
the beast. This beast religion—manism—the
Catholic sect, was now looked upon as the church. It
was considered the only way to heaven. There was no
salvation outside her walls. The true church was hidden.
The sun, moon and stars were eclipsed. Christ
had given his authority over to the pope, so it was
believed, and the Romish sect stepped into the place
of the true church. Christ and his church—the lights
of the world—were no longer seen. The pope and
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page425">[pg 425]</span><a name="Pg425" id="Pg425" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
his church stood up in their sins and abominations,
and the world looked upon them as the church. This
is certainly sufficient cause for darkness at the noonday.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Ver. 4. <span class="tei tei-q">“And they worshiped the dragon which
gave power unto the beast: and they worshiped the
beast, saying, Who is like unto the beast? Who is
able to make war with him?”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The people worshiped not only the church of Rome,
but both church and state; for they were now consolidated.
So the people worshiped the dragon and the
beast, and boasted of their greatness.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Ver. 5. <span class="tei tei-q">“And there was given unto him a mouth
speaking great things and blasphemies; and power
was given unto him to continue forty and two
months.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
From this text there opens a wide field before us,
which we will enter for a while, and then return
again to the further consideration of this chapter.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The pope's claims of power to forgive sins, to be
infallible, to be the vicegerent of the Son of God, to
have power to deliver from purgatory, and a number
of other shameful pretensions, are certainly shocking
blasphemies. Power was given him forty and two
months.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In Rev. 12:6, the woman (the church) is described
as fleeing into the wilderness prepared for her of
God, there to be fed a thousand two hundred and
three score days. Here we learn that the woman fled
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page426">[pg 426]</span><a name="Pg426" id="Pg426" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
from before the dragon and was protected of God (or
fed) from the dragon's power for a thousand two
hundred and three score days. This is virtually the
same power; namely, the Romish state and church,
that continued forty and two months as spoken of
above.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In Rev. 11:3 we have another allusion made to the
church of God at this period. <span class="tei tei-q">“And I will give power
unto my two witnesses, and they shall prophesy a
thousand two hundred and three score days, clothed
in sackcloth.”</span> A day in Scripture is used in different
texts to represent different lengths of time. In
some texts quoted in the introduction of this work
a day is used to represent the whole of the Christian
dispensation. Again it is said that <span class="tei tei-q">“one day is with
the Lord as a thousand years, and a thousand years
as one day.”</span> In Rev. 11:11, a day is used to represent
one hundred years; and in Ezek. 4:6, we learn
that a day is often used to represent one year. A
day in Rev. 11:3 and 12:6 signifies one year. Forty
and two months (as mentioned in Rev. 13:5) are
equal to 1260 days, allowing 30 days to the month.
Here also a day signifies a year. Thus the beast supported
by the dragon had power 1260 years. While
this beast was in authority the woman was in obscurity,
which was 1260 years. While the beast was in
power and the woman in silence the two witnesses
could only testify in sackcloth, which was 1260 years.
These two witnesses in the church of God are the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page427">[pg 427]</span><a name="Pg427" id="Pg427" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Word of God, and the Spirit of God. A sackcloth
dress is one donned in a time of grief or lamentation.
The Word and Spirit of God, because of the sad
state of the church, were draped in mourning or
sackcloth.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
We have before learned that the date of the rise
of the apostasy was 270 A.D. By these prophecies
made plain by the Holy Spirit we clearly understand
the first beast as seen in the apostasy was to continue
1260 years, which added to 270 years will bring us
down to 1530 A.D. At this date we have the Lutheran
reformation, when the power of Catholicism as a
universal state church was broken. The world as a
whole no longer looked upon that dark, ungodly institution
as the only way to heaven. They saw there
was salvation outside the pales of Romanism.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Now we will return to Rev. 13th chapter. Ver. 6.
<span class="tei tei-q">“And he opened his mouth in blasphemy against God,
to blaspheme his name, and his tabernacle, and them
that dwell in heaven.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
We have already spoken of how the papacy uttered
blasphemy against God and his name, his church and
his true people.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Ver. 7. <span class="tei tei-q">“And it was given unto him to make war
with the saints, and to overcome them: and power was
given him over all kindreds, and tongues, and
nations.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Catholicism numbers her slain by the thousands. If
your human heart can endure the reading of a book
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page428">[pg 428]</span><a name="Pg428" id="Pg428" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
on martyrdom and the tortures of the inquisition, you
would there learn that it was the Romish sect that
made war with and overcame the saints. To her was
granted power over kings and nations. While the
state gave her her power, she in turn rose to power
and rule over the state.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Ver. 8. <span class="tei tei-q">“And all that dwell upon the earth shall
worship him, whose names were not written in the
book of life of the Lamb slain from the foundation
of the world.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Ver. 9. <span class="tei tei-q">“If any man have an ear to hear, let him
hear.”</span>

Ver. 10. <span class="tei tei-q">“He that leadeth into captivity shall go
into captivity: he that killeth with the sword must
be killed with the sword. Here is the patience and
the faith of the saints.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
All worshiped the papacy except those who were
really spiritual, and those were slain. The tenth verse
is a prophecy against her; as she killed with the
sword, so she shall be killed with the sword (the Word
of God).
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Ver. 11. <span class="tei tei-q">“And I beheld another beast coming up
out of the earth: and he had two horns like a lamb,
and he spake as a dragon.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Here appears upon the scene another beast. A human
ecclesiasticism, a manism. Protestant authors
who brand the first beast as the Roman hierarchy
are confounded at the appearance of this second beast.
By these two beasts we understand the apostasy to be
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page429">[pg 429]</span><a name="Pg429" id="Pg429" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
under two forms. We have no hesitancy in branding
this second beast as Protestantism. In the church of
God all is controlled exclusively by the Holy Spirit.
There is no manism in the church of God, therefore
it is not animal or beastly. All sectism is controlled
largely by man, therefore is a beast power. At first
Protestantism had a mild, gentle, lamb-like appearance
compared with Catholicism.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The two horns are two state powers that gave support
to the beast. Germany and England supported
Protestantism, therefore are the two horns. The
dragon spoken of in this eleventh verse is, like in
the second verse and also in chapter 12:3, a state
power.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This second beast <span class="tei tei-q">“exercised all the power of the
first beast before him.”</span> See ver. 12. Was this not true
in England, where the king was head of both church
and state? Consequently we see that the second beast
or man religion spoken of was authorized by a dragon
or state power. In verse thirteen it is said he doeth
great wonders, so that he maketh fire come down from
heaven on the earth. Throughout the reign of Protestantism
there has been frequent spiritual revivals
and reformations. God really sent the Holy Spirit
fire upon the honest efforts of men, and wonders were
accomplished betimes in the name of Jesus.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In the fourteenth verse it is said that he deceived
them that dwell on the earth by the means of those
miracles which he did. Each reformation in the past
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page430">[pg 430]</span><a name="Pg430" id="Pg430" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
three centuries was begun by holy men, upon whom
God sent the holy fire; but others rising up subsequently,
who were devoid of spirituality, built upon
their foundation, and now deceive the people in making
them believe that they and their sect institutions
are of God because God manifested himself to their
predecessors. In this verse we also learn that an
image was made unto the first beast. Upon the work
of each reformer a sect institution was organized,
which was fashioned after the Roman Catholic sect
the mother of all sects.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
According to the words of the fifteenth verse these
images will in some future day, which the Lord
knows, find a consummation in one great image, unto
which all bow and pay homage or else suffer martyrdom.
To receive the mark of the beast as spoken of
in verse sixteen is to receive the ceremonies and customs
and doctrines peculiar to each respective sect.
Any one acquainted with the customs and doctrines of
the different denominations can to-day determine to
what denomination a stranger belongs by his dress
or manner of speech. The number six hundred sixty-six
refers to the number of leading religious denominations.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
We will now, briefly as possible, consider the first
eight verses of the seventeenth chapter of Revelation.
In verse one John speaks of seeing a great whore sitting
upon many waters. In verse two he speaks of the
kings of the earth becoming drunk on the wine of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page431">[pg 431]</span><a name="Pg431" id="Pg431" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
her fornication. This has all been true in the papacy.
There is in this hierarchy an enchanting, delusive spirit
that has intoxicated her subjects. This is the real
secret of her power.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In Rev. 17:5 the apostasy is termed <span class="tei tei-q">“Mystery,
Babylon the Great, The Mother of Harlots and Abominations
of the Earth.”</span> Here we see again the apostasy
in two forms or generations. The mother is the
first, and is identical with the first beast of Rev. 13:1.
The harlot daughters are the second, and are identical
with the second beast of Rev. 13:11. We consider
it needful to enquire what is meant by the term

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
There is the natural world and the spiritual world.
Babylon has existed under both. There are many
references made to it in both the Old and New Testaments.
In the Old Testament we find the origin
and final doom of literal Babylon. In the Apocalypse
we find the origin and final doom of spiritual Babylon,
the antitype. In the days of Noah the world became
very wicked and God destroyed all save Noah and
his family. For a time after the flood the people
were righteous and the whole earth was one language
and one speech. Gen. 11:1. God's people in those
days all spoke the same language and understood each
other, because they understood truth as it was.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“And it came to pass, as they journeyed from the
east, that they found a plain in the land of Shinar;
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page432">[pg 432]</span><a name="Pg432" id="Pg432" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
and they dwelt there. And they said one to another,
Go to, let us make brick, and burn them thoroughly.
And they had brick for stone, and slime had they for
mortar. And they said, Go to, let us build us a city
and a tower, whose top may reach unto heaven; and
let us make us a name, lest we be scattered abroad
upon the face of the whole earth.”</span> Gen. 11:2-4.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
God's people started on a pilgrimage in the order
of God, but they tarried, they ceased to <span class="tei tei-q">“go forward.”</span>
Had God's people continued on Babylon
would never have been built. This has its spiritual
import. When God's spiritual people cease to advance,
when they get out of God's order, they will
soon seek some other way to heaven.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This ancient city of Babylon grew until it became
a mighty, resistless, universal empire. For a time in
its history it held the people of God in captivity. The
day came, however, when this mighty city passed
away forever. The only dwellers among its lonely
ruins are wild beasts and hissing serpents. The Babylon
mentioned in Revelation is the spiritual antitype.
The great tower of ancient Babel finds its antitype
in mystery Babylon, the mother, and the diversified
city at its feet finishes its antitype in the multiplicity
of sects and creeds, where they speak a different spiritual
language, as they cluster around their mother's
knee. In this great apostate Babylon the true children
of God have long been taken captive, but the day
comes when God's own make their escape and return
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page433">[pg 433]</span><a name="Pg433" id="Pg433" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
to spiritual Jerusalem, their native home. The Revelator
beholds spiritual Babylon in a fallen condition
inhabited only by foul, devilish spirits, and unclean
and hateful birds. Rev. 18:2.

There are many prophecies in Daniel and other
chapters of Revelation relating to the dark apostasy
of the noonday, which we reluctantly forbear to consider
in this work, but are compelled to do so lest
our volume swell to too great proportions.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In the conclusion of this chapter we desire to make
a few quotations from other authors concerning mystery
Babylon and her harlot daughters.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“This woman (popery) is called the mother of harlots
and abominations. Who are the daughters? The
Lutheran, the Presbyterian, and the Episcopalian are
all branches of the Roman Catholic. Are not these
demonstrated harlots and abominations in the above
passage? I so decide. I could not, with the stake
before me decide, otherwise. Presbyterians and Episcopalians
compose a part of Babylon. They hold the
distinctive principles of papacy in common with
papists.”</span>—<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Tennessee Baptist.</span></span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“I think Christ has a true church on earth, but its
members are scattered among the various denominations,
and are more or less under the influence of mystery
Babylon and her daughters.”</span>—<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Bible Doctrine</span></span>

in general, and happy had it been for the
world were that the case. But although we are fully
warranted to consider that church as the mother of
harlots, the truth is that by whatsoever arguments we
succeed in fixing that odious charge upon her, we shall
by parity of reasoning be obliged to allow other national
churches to be her unchaste daughters, and for
this plain reason, among others, because in their very
constitution and tendency they are hostile to the nature
of the kingdom of Christ.”</span>—<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Encyclopedia of

These dogmas are without Scriptural authority.
They are only the traditions of men, and is it any
wonder that the pure light of the gospel of the Son
of God was dimmed when such blasphemous doctrines
were substituted? Besides these, in the papacy originated
many other erroneous superstitious doctrines
that have been handed down and perpetuated through
Protestantism. One of the most general is that of

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This ceremony is wholly without Scriptural foundation.
We have previously shown the true object
and mode of baptism, and who are proper candidates.
We asked a mother recently, whose babe had just
been <span class="tei tei-q">“christened,”</span> as she termed it, by a Methodist
preacher, <span class="tei tei-q">“What benefit has your child derived from
this ceremony?”</span> Her answer was like this: <span class="tei tei-q">“None
at all, but I had it done because others do it.”</span>
And so it is with many other traditions and customs
of men. Many a parent has their babe <span class="tei tei-q">“christened”</span>
merely because it is a custom, or the preacher has said
so, never searching the Word of God to know the
reason why. Had she searched the Word of the
Lord to know something of this doctrine she never
would have found the object of her search. As we
look upon the <span class="tei tei-q">“christening”</span> of an infant we are
reminded more of heathendom than of the kingdom of
grace.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The word <span class="tei tei-q">“christen”</span> we have not been able to
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page437">[pg 437]</span><a name="Pg437" id="Pg437" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
find in the Bible. Nowhere since the ordinance of
baptism was instituted have we a commandment to
baptize infants, and nowhere in all the evangelistic
work of the apostles is there an instance of infant
baptism recorded. If it is as important as some
teach, even the child's eternal destiny depending upon
it, do you not think there would have been some
plain commandment in the teaching of Jesus and
his apostles to that end? One command would be
sufficient, but we have none. Infant baptism originated
in the confusions of the apostasy. John
refused to baptize some because they bore no fruit of
repentance. Repentance, therefore, must precede baptism.
This was plainly taught by Peter. <span class="tei tei-q">“Then
Peter said unto them, Repent, and be baptized every
one of you in the name of Jesus.”</span> Acts 2:38. A
little child can not repent, and needs no repentance.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Does baptizing an infant prepare it for heaven?
If so, give one text as proof. If an unbaptized infant
dies, will it be damned? If so, give one text as
proof. Does baptism make the child any more religiously
inclined, and will it not go into sin the same
as unbaptized children? Give one text showing what
is effected by infant baptism. Thousands are having
their children baptized, and they do not know the
reason why any more than that it is a custom. Thus we
behold the meaninglessness, looseness, and carelessness

a Scriptural reason for all we do in our form of

Some have taught that circumcision of the Old Testament
typifies infant baptism. This is a gross error.
The circumcision of the Mosaic law is typical
of a broken, penitent heart. <span class="tei tei-q">“For he is not a Jew,
that is one outwardly; neither is that circumcision,
which is outward in the flesh; but he is a Jew, which
is one inwardly, and circumcision is that of the heart,
in the spirit, and not in the letter; whose praise is
not of men, but of God.”</span> Rom. 2:28, 29. A man was
made a Jew under the old law by circumcision. He
is made a spiritual Jew by the circumcision of the
heart under the New Testament. It was only the
male children that were circumcised according to the
law of Moses. If circumcision be typical of infant
baptism, it is only the boy infant that would be
Scripturally baptized. You may ask, <span class="tei tei-q">“What harm
can result from such ceremony, even if it accomplishes
no good?”</span> It leads the child into error, and
blinds his understanding to the true mode and object
of baptism. To be a light in the world is to
be and do just as Jesus did. To be in error concerning
any doctrine of the Bible is to be to that
extent in darkness.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The baptism of infants is wholly without Scriptural
foundation, and is one of the erroneous teachings
of the apostasy, a doctrine that aided in darkening
the pure light of the gospel.

only Scriptural one. We have no account of sprinkling
and pouring until the third century. The Novatians
practised it in the third century. When
we understand the true object of baptism, and what
it represents, we find that sprinkling and pouring
would be altogether inappropriate.

This is another doctrine of the apostasy. We have
before stated that baptism represents a burial. Rom.
6:4. We can at once see the inappropriateness of
three immersions. So far as we know all trine immersionists
immerse forward. This does not fitly
represent a burial. The baptismal formula of Mat. 28:19
is the trine immersionists strongest proof-text.
<span class="tei tei-q">“In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of
the Holy Ghost.”</span> These three, we are told, are one.
1 John 5:7. There are three personages in the Godhead,

three acts of faith for pardon, yet we are told to believe

Christ is to be baptized in the name of the full triune
God, because in him dwelleth all the fulness of the
Godhead. Col 2:9.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The disciples well understood the Savior in his
commission in Mat. 28:19. They baptized under
his direction before the commission. One act in the
name of the Lord Jesus is all we can find them practising.
<span class="tei tei-q">“And he commanded them to be baptized in
the name of the Lord.”</span> Acts 10:48. <span class="tei tei-q">“When they

Trine immersionists make use of such historical records
to establish the doctrine of trine immersion. Instead
of being in its favor, it is against them. They
were at this time under the delusions of a heresy.
Apostate teachers had elected exorcists in what they
called the church, whose business it was to expel the
devil from the candidate for baptism. This is an
awful heresy. Those of whom Tertullian writes disown
the devil under the hand of these exorcists and
are then thrice baptized. Tertullian understands,
however, that this heresy is performing more than
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page441">[pg 441]</span><a name="Pg441" id="Pg441" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the Lord Jesus had appointed. Sprinkling, pouring,

To-day the teachers in Babylon and their subjects
are in darkness concerning church organization. The
election of officers and their framing of laws, and
the location of the ministers by the annual conference
are all human authority, and belong to the apostasy.
The Holy Spirit is the sole organizer in the church of
the Bible. There are a few texts in which the Holy
Spirit is spoken of as working in conjunction with
man, or using man as an agency. This is very limited.
Conferences claim to work in conjunction with
the Holy Spirit, but we have no such instances in the
Scripture. One minister told me he trusted the Holy
Spirit to direct conference to give him the proper
appointment. This is popish—man not able to be directed
by the Holy Spirit himself, but has a mediator.

Our space will prevent our telling of the adding
of tradition to the Scripture, and of the rejection of
much of the Word of God. Catholicism and Protestantism
largely deny the doctrine of holiness. Some
of the Protestant teachers teach holiness to a degree,
but very few, or none of them, teach true Bible holiness.
By far the large majority of sectarians reject
the doctrine of Christian perfection, heart purity, or
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page442">[pg 442]</span><a name="Pg442" id="Pg442" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
freedom from sin. Is it any wonder they are a great
object of darkness when they are living in and can
not be free from the very element of darkness? There
is no light in them. The vast majority of the beast
worshipers reject the doctrine of divine healing. As
plainly as it is recorded in the Bible, they in the
darkness comprehend it not. The whole of the sectarian
world denies the unity of God's people as
taught by the Savior, and as experienced by the church
in the morning light. Nearly the whole of mystery
Babylon and her harlot daughters reject the sacred
ordinance of feet-washing. Some of them deny all
the ordinances, and the others have misused and misapplied
them so as to make them without meaning.
But few sects that practise the lifting up of holy
hands, and the greeting with a holy kiss.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The humble ordinances of feet-washing and greeting
with a holy kiss are very repugnant to the generality
of proud-hearted sectarians. They look upon
these ordinances as being degrading to morality.
They call it an <span class="tei tei-q">“act which public decency abhors.”</span>
Here they are mistaken: it is not public decency that
abhors it; it is a proud heart. A holy kiss is not
indecent, whether it be public or private.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Proud, sensual hearts have very depraved ideas of
what is true decency. We will here give an authentic

heart consider a public indecency, moral degrading,
Christian disgracing and soul damning.

Burns, a little town about twenty miles from Buffalo,

the ladies advertised a social in the church to raise
money to pay the preacher and buy some coal. The

is not a text in the Bible but what is rejected or perverted

I would ask the reader to look at the plain, simple
truths of the Bible as taught by the Savior and the
disciples. Picture to your mind, by what knowledge
you have of Scripture, the life of Christ and the
apostles and the church in their day. Notice their
humility, their equality, their care for souls, their privations,
their persecutions, their holiness, their faith
for healing the sick, their oneness, their unselfishness,
their love for each other, their separation from the
world, and their belief of the whole truth. Alongside
of this place a picture of the religious denominations
of to-day with their proud, highly educated
and high-salaried ministry, rejecting much of the
Bible; denying holiness and the humble ordinances,
no healing faith, assuming proud titles, building fine
temples, living in ease and luxury, joined to the world

free from persecution—their greed for money, their

beastly sect religion has darkened the pure church of

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This is not a Bible word, nor a Bible doctrine. It is
a word and teaching of the apostasy. The word is
used to denote a thousand years. The most general
teaching of the millennialist is that there will be a
personal reign of Christ upon this earth of a thousand
years after his second coming. There are very
many theories respecting the millennium. This of
itself is enough to make the doctrine very questionable.
If there is such a doctrine in the Bible it should
be so sufficiently clear as to not admit of so much
disagreement. The millennial doctrine as taught by
sectarian teachers we emphatically declare to be wholly
without Scriptural foundation. It is a purpose of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page446">[pg 446]</span><a name="Pg446" id="Pg446" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Satan to cause man to place what should be a present
realization to some time in the past or future.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In the days previous to the coming of Christ the
Jews were in great expectation concerning the kingdom
of God. They looked forward with great joy
and anticipation to the coming of Christ, their King,
who should set up a kingdom which should never
be destroyed. They expected him to reign in a pomp
and splendor that excelled the Cæsars. The kingdom
of God came, but their proud hearts and high mind
overlooked it altogether. The same is true to-day.
The cold formal professors in Babylon see in the
Bible a glowing description of the kingdom of God,
and they, failing to come to its present and blessed
realizations, have come to the conclusion that it must
be in an age to come.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
With perfect confidence we say there is not one
text in the Bible speaking of the glory of Christ's
kingdom but what is fulfilled here in salvation or
in the eternal glory world above. There is no intervening
state of peace and righteousness. We
will briefly notice some of the principal texts used
by millennial teachers, and we will find almost every
one, if not every one, refers to the wonders of salvation
here in this life. Mr. Talmage, in a sermon
in October 1898, said in referring to Isa. 35:6: <span class="tei tei-q">“In
the millennial the lame man shall leap as an hart.”</span>
Where can we behold a greater exposition of Bible
ignorance? There is not a sentence in the whole of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page447">[pg 447]</span><a name="Pg447" id="Pg447" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
this chapter but points to the blessings of grace in
this gospel day. Did not the lame man leap as an
hart in the days of Christ and the apostles? Why
will man be so unfair or so blind as to place the
fulfilment of such prophecies in a millennial, when
every word has been fulfilled, and is being fulfilled
to-day, in those who are possessing the fulness of
Christ's kingdom?
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
A text quoted by millennial teachers everywhere is
found in Isa. 11:6-8: <span class="tei tei-q">“The wolf also shall dwell with
the lamb, and the leopard shall lie down with
the kid; and the calf and the young lion and the
fatling together; and a little child shall lead them.
And the cow and the bear shall feed; their young
ones shall lie down together: and the lion shall eat
straw like the ox. And the sucking child shall play
on the hole of the asp, and the weaned child shall
put his hand on the cockatrice' den.”</span> In the next
verse you will learn where this peacefulness shall
reign.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“They shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy
mountain.”</span> It is in God's holy mountain where they
shall not hurt nor destroy. What is God's holy mountain?
It is Zion, the church. <span class="tei tei-q">“And it shall come to
pass in the last days [the gospel days] that the mountain
of the Lord's house shall be established in the
top of the mountains, and shall be exalted above the
hills; and all nations [both Jew and Gentile] shall
flow unto it. And many people shall go and say,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page448">[pg 448]</span><a name="Pg448" id="Pg448" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Come ye; and let us go up to the mountain of the
Lord, to the house of the God of Jacob; and he will
teach us of his ways, and we will walk in his paths:
for out of Zion shall go forth the law, and the word
of the Lord from Jerusalem.”</span> Isa. 2:2, 3.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This is surely too plain to need comment, Zion is
the Lord's mountain. The wolf dwelling with the
Lamb is figurative language, and never will be literally
fulfilled, but has been spiritually and figuratively
fulfilled throughout the whole of this Christian dispensation.
It shows the wonders of God's grace.
Jesus called Herod a <span class="tei tei-q">“fox.”</span> Luke 13:32. He certainly
did not mean that he was truly a fox, but that
he had a thieving, dishonest, foxlike disposition. Paul
says, <span class="tei tei-q">“Beware of dogs.”</span> Phil. 3:2. He is not giving
us a warning against this literal animal, but against
men that have a fierce and doglike nature. Jesus
again says, <span class="tei tei-q">“Beware of false prophets, which come to
you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly they are ravening
wolves.”</span> Mat. 7:15. Here we learn that men
are inwardly ravening wolves; that is, they have a
devouring, wolflike disposition. Thus we could continue.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In Isa. 35:9 it says that no lion shall be in the
highway of holiness. In a Christian's holy life there
is no lionlike nature. God's salvation saves men from
such dispositions. And the whole of Isa. 11:6-8 is a
prophecy relating to this present time, when the salvation
of Jesus saves men from all wolf, bear, lion,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page449">[pg 449]</span><a name="Pg449" id="Pg449" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
and leopardlike natures, and fills all with a peaceable
nature, that an innocent child shall lead them.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Please read the first verse of this chapter. Do we
not find its fulfilment in Christ? Also read the tenth
verse. Does it not point to the Savior? It all relates
to the time when Christ shall come and the
Gentile can be saved as well as the Jew. The ninth
verse is often misquoted. Many say that in the
millennium <span class="tei tei-q">“righteousness shall cover the earth as
the waters cover the sea.”</span> Such is not Scripture.
But in this ninth verse it is said, <span class="tei tei-q">“The earth shall
be full of the knowledge of the Lord, as the waters
cover the sea.”</span> This relates to the coming of Christ,
when not only the Jews shall have the Word of God
and a knowledge of him, but every nation is granted
the Bible and salvation.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
One strong text for millennial teachers, as they suppose,
is Acts 3:21: <span class="tei tei-q">“Whom [Christ] the heavens
must receive until the times of restitution of all things,
which God hath spoken by the mouth of all his holy
prophets since the world began.”</span> A text they use to
teach there shall be a thousand years in which restitution
is to be made, makes no such intimation. In
fact, it teaches to the contrary. Let us carefully examine
it. Christ was taken up to heaven. He will
some day come again. Acts 1:11. The positive teaching
of this text is that the heavens will retain the
Lord Jesus until everything is restored to the Father.
Christ came to restore all things. Mat. 17:11. Full
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page450">[pg 450]</span><a name="Pg450" id="Pg450" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
restitution for sin was made by the Savior. The
Holy Spirit all through this dispensation is leading
men to the blood and restoring them to the Father.
The day will soon come when the Holy Spirit has
gleaned out the last one and all has been restored to
the Father that will be restored. This then is the
full restitution of all things. Then the heavens will
retain the Son of God no longer. He will come to
claim his own. Instead of this text teaching that
restitution is to be made after Christ's second coming,
it teaches that the restitution is to be made before
he comes the second time.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
We will now ask the reader to read the only text
that speaks of a thousand years. This is found in
Rev. 20:1-10. If you will open your Bible and read,
we can by the help of the Lord show you that this can
not possibly mean a thousand years of Christ's reign
upon the earth after his second coming. This language
is figurative. Satan is an evil spirit and can
not be bound with a literal chain. After the thousand
years have expired, Satan is to be loosed, and shall deceive
the nations. After Christ reigns here a thousand
years in righteousness shall Satan be loosed and
deceive the nations? Who can look forward to such
an end with joy? How do you know but you will be
one that will be deceived? If you are building hopes
upon a millennium you are already deceived, and
this deception is among the deceptions which are to
come after the thousand years. This thousand years
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page451">[pg 451]</span><a name="Pg451" id="Pg451" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
is in the past. This may be a startling statement to
one who has been educated to believe in a reign of
Christ in person here upon the earth in some future
age of a thousand years' duration. Reader, will you
please notice that the devil and Satan, that was to be
bound a thousand years, is also called the dragon?
Now the Scriptures do not always mean Beelzebub
when speaking of Satan. Jesus upon one occasion,
because Peter was remonstrating with him concerning
his death, said, <span class="tei tei-q">“Get thee behind me, Satan.”</span> Christ
did not mean to say that Peter was the devil, but he
addressed him as Satan, because the devil was using
him as an instrument to persuade the Savior to escape
the death he came here to endure for all. So
Satan and the devil spoken of in Rev. 20:2 does not
refer to the personal devil, the prince of evil spirits,
but to some great power antagonistical to gospel light
and truth as revealed in the church of God.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Now we feel ourself under obligation to the reader
to give him the correct interpretation of this binding
of Satan a thousand years, and of his being
loosed at the end of that period. The term <span class="tei tei-q">“dragon”</span>
is used to represent a state power, which gives
power to some religion antagonistical to the religion of
the Bible. However the original and real fundamental
dragon power was Rome, when she supported a
heathen religion, and when the world on the whole
was so under the seducing charms of idolatrous worship
that it knew not the one true God and his
relationship to man. The Syriac New Testament, in
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page452">[pg 452]</span><a name="Pg452" id="Pg452" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
speaking of this dragon in verse two, says, <span class="tei tei-q">“Who seduced
the whole habitable world.”</span> The binding of
Satan refers to some time when the delusive charms
of heathenish worship were largely cleared away and
there became a greater universal knowledge of the
true God. At the end of that thousand years, or
long period of time, which time we have reached, the
true God and the pure religion will be lost or unknown
to the generality of mankind, and heathenish
rites and customs and ceremonies will be the universal
religion. Do we not read that at the end of the
thousand years Satan shall again deceive the nations?
We understand by this that the world on the whole
shall be reveling in the delusive seductions of a lewd,
lustful, idolatrous religion, making the times like it
was in the days of Noah. Let me again say we are
now entering these times, and this world is swiftly
passing under awful and blinding delusions. So
great are the delusions that if possible the very elect
should be deceived.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The religious teachers of to-day on the whole are
in ignorance concerning the binding of Satan. We
will give you a sample of the ignorance of these teachers.
In the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Gospel Messenger</span></span> of March 25, 1899, the
Querist Department in answer to a question asked
concerning the binding of Satan, said: <span class="tei tei-q">“Satan will
then be bound, cast into the bottomless pit, and there
will be a chance to convert the unrighteous and lead
them to accept Christ as the Savior.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
A subscriber in search of knowledge asked the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page453">[pg 453]</span><a name="Pg453" id="Pg453" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Querist Department to give a scripture to prove the
last clause. He received this answer: <span class="tei tei-q">“It seems to us
that it is one of those self-evident views that needs no
proof. If the Bible teaches otherwise let us have the
chapter and verse. The Querist Department does not

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
We have now passed the noonday. The reader,
no doubt, fully comprehends why it was dark. The
morning was light because the whole Word of truth
was taught and experienced by the church. All were
under the immediate control of the infallible Holy
Spirit.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The noonday was dark because the leadings and
teachings of fallible man were substituted for the
Holy Spirit and Word. A thousand errors were
brought in, the Word of God rejected. The faith
once delivered to the saints was lost, sin and iniquity
abounded and their love waxed cold. The preachers
divined for money, and sought places of affluence, and
thus the day was dark over them. Sectism to-day is
a mass of worldliness. Infidelity abounds and every
abominable work. If you desire a perfect description
of sectism as it appears upon the scene to-day, read
that given by the angel in Rev. 18:2.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In our introduction we gave a number of texts
which spoke of the whole of the gospel dispensation as
one day; but any period of time distinguished by
some extraordinary historic event may be and is also
termed a day. The apostasy or dark noonday being
under two forms is marked in Bible history as two
days. The first form of the apostasy, namely, Catholicism,
is called by the Scriptures a <span class="tei tei-q">“dark day.”</span>
</p>

<div class="tei tei-div" style="margin-bottom: 3.00em; margin-top: 3.00em">
<h3 class="tei tei-head" style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 2.40em; margin-top: 2.40em"><span style="font-size: 120%">A Cloudy Day.</span></h3>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The second form of the apostasy was not such utter
darkness as the first, and is therefore called a
cloudy day. <span class="tei tei-q">“For thus saith the Lord God; Behold,
I, even I, will both search my sheep, and seek them
out. As a shepherd seeketh out his flock in the day
that he is among his sheep that are scattered; so will
I seek out my sheep, and will deliver them out of all
places where they have been scattered in the cloudy
and dark day.”</span> Ezek. 34:11, 12. The cloudy day
was a day of the scattering of God's people. This
has been true of Protestantism. God's own people
have been divided and scattered among the various
organizations of man. The time of the seeking out
refers to the evening, when God is going to gather
his children together that <span class="tei tei-q">“were scattered abroad,”</span>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page456">[pg 456]</span><a name="Pg456" id="Pg456" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
and they shall be <span class="tei tei-q">“one heart and one soul”</span> as in the
morning.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
One more text refers to the cloudy day. <span class="tei tei-q">“And it
shall come to pass in that day that the light shall
not be clear, nor dark: but it shall be one day which
shall be known to the Lord, not day, nor night: but
it shall come to pass, that at evening time it shall
be light.”</span> Zech. 14:6, 7. This day of Protestantism
was neither <span class="tei tei-q">“clear nor dark”</span>; was neither <span class="tei tei-q">“day, nor
night.”</span> It was a mixture of light and darkness, truth
and error, and therefore is fitly termed a cloudy day.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
After those two days there shall be a great revival
caused by the outpouring of the Holy Spirit. <span class="tei tei-q">“Come,
and let us return unto the Lord: for he hath torn,
and he will heal us; he hath smitten, and he will bind
us up. After two days will he revive us: in the
third day he will raise us up, and we shall live in his
sight. Then shall we know, if we follow on to know
the Lord: his going forth is prepared as the morning;
and he shall come unto us as the rain, as the latter
and former rain unto the earth.”</span> Hos. 6:1-3.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The two days of beastly power come to an end. The
time comes when they shall no longer govern God's
true people. It was true of literal Babylon, that had
taken captive the children of God, that the time came
when they returned from their captivity. The same
is true of spiritual Babylon. The children of God
have long been taken captive in her. In the evening
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page457">[pg 457]</span><a name="Pg457" id="Pg457" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
time, after two days, they shall say, <span class="tei tei-q">“Come, let us
return unto the Lord: for he hath torn, and he will
heal us; he will revive us in the third day, he will
raise us up,”</span> etc. Praise God! Then shall we know
the Lord. <span class="tei tei-q">“His going forth is prepared as the morning.”</span>
Just as God was known in the morning in his
holiness and power, just so he will be known in the
evening. Throughout the <span class="tei tei-q">“two days”</span> (apostasy) the
Lord in his power to save to the uttermost, to heal,
and to exclusively control his church was unknown.
Therefore he says: <span class="tei tei-q">“Then shall the seers be ashamed,
and the diviners confounded: yea, they shall all cover
their lips; for there is no answer of God.”</span> Micah 3:7.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Such is the ignorance of the seers of Babylon. They
are educated in the wisdom of the world, but know
little of God. Their sermons are the theories of man,
and not the pure Word of God. For this reason
there is a great spiritual famine in Babylon.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The evening time is called the third day, when God
shall send copious showers of rain. The first day is a
<span class="tei tei-q">“dark day,”</span> and relates to the reign of the Catholic
power. The second or dark and cloudy day relates to
the reign of Protestantism. The third day is the
<span class="tei tei-q">“time of the end,”</span> when there shall be a consumption
of the beast powers. Dan. 7:26. Daniel was told
that the fourth beast he saw in his vision was a
fourth kingdom. This was the Roman kingdom.
Three had preceded—the Babylonian, Medo-Persian
and Grecian. This beast had ten horns. Ver. 7. These
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page458">[pg 458]</span><a name="Pg458" id="Pg458" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
ten horns were ten kings, or kingdoms, which were
created out of the Roman empire by the barbarians
of the North. History records the overrunning of the
Roman empire from A.D. 376 to A.D. 476 by the
different <span class="tei tei-q">“powerful and warlike nations of the
North; namely, the Huns, Goths, Vandals,”</span> etc. Thus
in one century of time the kingdom of the Cæsars gave
rise to ten different minor kingdoms.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In verse twenty-four of Daniel seven the prophet
was told that another horn should arise after these
ten. From the description of this horn we at once
learn it to represent the Roman hierarchy, or to be
the same as the first beast of Rev. 13. In verse twenty-six
the prophet says, <span class="tei tei-q">“Judgment shall sit, and they
shall take away his dominion, to consume and to destroy
it unto the end.”</span> The apostasy is being consumed
by the powerful and sharp judgments of God's
Word being executed by the faithful and true who
are proclaiming, <span class="tei tei-q">“Fear God, and give glory to him,
for the hour of his judgment is come.”</span> This is in the
time of the end, this glorious evening hour.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The apostle Paul gives a description of the apostasy
in 2 Thes. 2. In verse eight he speaks of its consumption,
which is being effected in this evening of
time. Babylon is being consumed. Hear her cries of
pain. The prophet Isaiah foretells the consumption
of the apostasy in these words: <span class="tei tei-q">“And the destruction
of the transgressors and of the sinners shall be together,
and they that forsake the Lord shall be consumed.”</span>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page459">[pg 459]</span><a name="Pg459" id="Pg459" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
This is being accomplished in this present
day. The gospel truth is being held up as a <span class="tei tei-q">“lamp
that burneth,”</span> and Babylon is consumed. The Lord
is washing <span class="tei tei-q">“away the filth of the daughter of Zion, ...
by the spirit of judgment, and by the spirit of
burning.”</span> Isa. 4:4.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Flee out of the midst of Babylon, and deliver every
man his soul.”</span>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
How light shall be the evening? Will God <span class="tei tei-q">“revive
us and raise us up”</span> in the third day to the apostolic
plane? The answer is, <span class="tei tei-q">“His going forth is prepared
as the morning.”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“Then shall thy light break forth
as the morning, and thine health shall spring forth
speedily: and thy righteousness shall go before thee;
the glory of the Lord shall be thy rearward.”</span> Isa.
58:8.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
By these two texts we are given to understand that
in the evening the light shall shine as bright as in the
morning. The church of God will be raised to the
same plane from which it was dragged down by ecclesiastical
lords. God's people shall enjoy the same
degree of holiness in the evening as they did in the
morning. They shall enjoy the same blessed unity—<span class="tei tei-q">“one
heart and one soul,”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“and all speak the same
thing.”</span> They shall possess apostolic faith. They
shall have power with God to heal the sick, to open
blinded eyes, to cause the lame to walk and the deaf
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page460">[pg 460]</span><a name="Pg460" id="Pg460" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
to hear, to cast out devils, and to raise the dead the
same as did the saints in the morning. Why shall
they be given such power? Because they believe, experience
and practise the whole truth. They are free
from all manism. God has absolute control in each
and every heart. Every hindrance to faith is removed,
every barrier between them and God is taken
away, and the Lord works with them, <span class="tei tei-q">“confirming
the word with signs following.”</span> Glory to his name!

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The morning was of 270 years' duration. The first
form of the apostasy lasted, as we have shown, 1260
years, bringing us to the Lutheran reformation in
1530. Now when we ascertain the duration of the
second beast power we will know the time the sun,
moon and stars reappear in the evening. One especial
text that gives us information on this subject is found
in Revelation. In speaking of the two witnesses the
Revelator says: <span class="tei tei-q">“And they that dwell upon the earth
shall rejoice over them, and make merry, and shall
send gifts one to another; because these two prophets
tormented them that dwelt on the earth. And after
three days and a half the Spirit of life from God
entered into them, and they stood upon their feet;
and great fear fell upon them which saw them.”</span>
Rev. 11:10, 11.
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page461">[pg 461]</span><a name="Pg461" id="Pg461" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In this we learn the duration of the power of Protestantism
and the breaking forth of the evening light.
We have before proven that a day in Scripture is
used to represent different lengths of time, sometimes
the whole of the Christian era, sometimes a
thousand years, sometimes a hundred years, and sometimes
a year. In this text a day represents a century.
Three days are three centuries, and a half day is a
half century. After three days and a half, which
are three centuries and a half, or 350 years, of the
reign of Protestantism, the Spirit of life from God
entered into them. This is the dawning of the evening,
when the whole and entire Word of God is believed
and experienced and the Holy Spirit has the same
power in governing the church of God as he did in
the days of the apostles. The downfall of the first
beast, or Romanism, and the arising of the second
beast, or Protestantism, was in the year 1530. The
duration of Protestant power is 350 years, which added
to 1530 brings us to the year 1880 A.D., at which
time the dark noonday closes and we emerging hail
with joy the peaceful glowing evening light.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Prior to the year 1880 it was, with rare exceptions,
universally conceded that to gain heaven we needs
must unite with some religious denomination. About
this time God by his Holy Spirit gave to men everywhere
(whose hearts were prepared) an intuitive
knowledge that we could be saved and live a Christian
life outside the walls of sectism. Just to lean upon
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page462">[pg 462]</span><a name="Pg462" id="Pg462" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
God alone and be guided solely by his Word and
Spirit, they discovered to be their blessed privilege.

</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In the few years prior to 1880 A.D., there was a
great declension in the spirituality of Protestantism.
Who can deny this fact? Quite a number of the leading
denominations held revivals, where was witnessed
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page463">[pg 463]</span><a name="Pg463" id="Pg463" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the power of the Holy Spirit. People were genuinely
converted. They loved and worshiped God in quite
a degree of simplicity and equality. The ministry
was of a humbler class and more devoted to its
charges. In the decade preceding 1880 there was
a great change. This change perhaps can be no better
described than is done in the following words of
Mr. Foster, bishop of the Methodist denomination:
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Worldly socials, fairs, festivals, concerts, and such
like, have taken the place of the religious gatherings,
revival meetings, class and prayer-meetings of earlier
days.... Under such worldly performance spirituality
is frozen to death.... The early Methodist
ministers went forth to sacrifice and suffer for Christ.
They sought not places of ease and affluence, but of
privation and suffering. They gloried not in their
big salaries, fine parsonages, and refined congregations,
but in the souls that had been won for Jesus.
Oh, how changed! A hireling ministry will be a
feeble, a timid truckling, a time-serving ministry,
without faith, endurance, and holy power. Methodism
formerly dealt in the great central truth. Now
the pulpits deal largely in generalities and in popular
lectures. The glorious doctrine of entire sanctification
is rarely heard and seldom witnessed in the
pulpits.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
There is not a Methodist minister but knows the
truthfulness of these statements, however much they
may deny it. In the quoted texts of Scripture
from Revelation 11, the ninth and tenth verses say:
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page464">[pg 464]</span><a name="Pg464" id="Pg464" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
<span class="tei tei-q">“And they of the people and kindreds and tongues
and nations shall see their dead bodies three days and
a half, and shall not suffer their dead bodies to be put
in graves. And they that dwell upon the earth shall
rejoice over them, and make merry, and shall send
gifts one to another.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
By the <span class="tei tei-q">“dead bodies”</span> is meant the two witnesses,
the Word and Spirit. These throughout Protestantism
were dead. While they professed to be led by the
Spirit and to believe and practise the Word, they
did neither. Thus they would not entirely and openly
in words deny the power of the Holy Spirit and verity
of God's Word, yet in works they did deny them.
<span class="tei tei-q">“They profess that they know God; but in works
they deny him, being abominable, and disobedient,
and unto every good work reprobate.”</span> Titus 1:16.
These two witnesses were dead, yet they would not
allow their dead bodies to be buried: they professed
to receive them.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The tenth verse tells of the worldliness of sectism
at the time the Spirit of life from God entered
into the Word and Holy Spirit, after the 350 years
or the ushering in of the evening light. They were
making merry and sending gifts. Sectism is straining
every nerve, and adopting most every scheme for
money-getting. The fundamental object in the socials,
fairs, concerts, etc., is to get money. They
adopt these worldly, sensual amusements to rob men
of their money. We have in possession a clipping
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page465">[pg 465]</span><a name="Pg465" id="Pg465" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

present-day performances and merry making for money,

<span class="tei tei-q">“Pittsburg, March 5.—The church edifice of the
Coraopolis Methodist church was advertised to be sold
by the sheriff this week, and the members of the congregation
made a heroic attempt all last week to save
it. Coraopolis is a few miles below here. One vivacious
young woman won a wager by riding a spirited
horse without a saddle; other good sisters and
brethren cleaned shoes and peddled, while some
pushed wheelbarrows in which were conveyed some
very staid-looking business men. The whole church
community was animated by the common desire to
keep the sheriff from the church-door. Luxuries were
denied, and many ludicrous situations were invented
until enough money was raised to secure a postponement
of the sale.</span>

The following article, recently published in a God-fearing,
religious paper, contains weighty and powerful
truths, and should awaken the reader to the present
condition of things in this dark, seducing, and
soul-deluding, sinful world.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“There has been for many years a rapid decline
among the Protestant churches of the spirit of revivals
and of the manifestations of the power of the
Holy Spirit. Not only is there great ignorance on
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page468">[pg 468]</span><a name="Pg468" id="Pg468" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the doctrines of the Bible, but almost universally a
positive antagonism to anything like the supernatural
in religious experience.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Just as Jesus was rejected and crucified by the
professed church at the close of the Jewish age, so the
Holy Spirit is being despised and crucified by the
professed church at the close of the Gentile age. Just
as Jesus was rejected from the nice homes of Bethlehem,
and had to go into a stable to find a place to
be born, and where he could utter his infant cries, so
the Holy Spirit to-day is utterly rejected from thousands
of Protestant churches, and he has to go into
rented halls, slum missions, canvas tents, and woods
meetings to find a place to utter his voice through the
lips of those who know and feel him. Just as there
were a few who had supernatural discernment to
recognize and worship the infant God, so there are
now a few who discern the personality and operation
of the Holy Spirit, and pour out to him their gold and
frankincense and myrrh. Just as the people of Bethlehem,
who had turned the unborn Savior from their
door were soon made to wail by the king's order of
assassination, so the thousands of nominal churches
which now reject the work of the Holy Spirit from
their doors will soon wail under the awful tribulation
that is rapidly coming on all the earth. Oh, if the
Protestant churches could only see the day of their
visitation, and that the history of the way the Jews
treated Jesus is being exactly repeated over and over
again in the way the modern churches treat the Holy
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page469">[pg 469]</span><a name="Pg469" id="Pg469" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Spirit, and that the same doom that overtook the Jewish
church for rejecting Christ, will speedily overtake
the modern churches for rejecting the Holy Spirit!</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Another feature of the present crisis is, God is
working mainly through individuals, and not so much
through machinery. Thousands of individuals in Europe
and America have been called of the Spirit to
launch out into soul-saving work along lines of personal
enterprise more than ever in past ages.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“There never was a time in the world's history when
Christian men and women felt so led of God not to
wait for committees nor the red tape of ecclesiastical
authority, but to hurry forth under a personal call
from God and do what they could with their individual
means and talents for the saving of souls, the
sanctifying of believers, and preparing the chosen few
to meet Jesus. There never seemed a time when anything
like church machinery would run to seed so
quick as now. Even if an enterprise that is started
definitely as a holiness work gets a few officers and
committees in it, in a few days or months it gets just
as churchly and high-headed and dictatorial as an old
popish institution. For this reason God is utilizing
individuality in his kingdom as never before.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Another feature of the present crisis is, that God
will test the faith of his waiting ones, and all those
persons who are making almanacs for the Lord, and
fixing dates for the fulfilling of certain prophecies,
are going to be disappointed. We are living a life
of faith in every particular, clear down to the last
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page470">[pg 470]</span><a name="Pg470" id="Pg470" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
moment of his appearing in the sky. The Scriptures
are very clear in setting forth two facts concerning
Christ's coming. On the one hand we are told of the
signs that would precede his coming, and we are told
to watch those things, and they will indicate his coming
as near; on the other hand we are expressly told
that the day and hour of his appearing will never be
made known beforehand, and our wisdom lies in not
forgetting the signs on the one hand, nor in fixing
dates on the other. Hence Jesus commands us to keep
in the attitude of a watcher, always ready, always expecting,
yet not knowing. In the parable of the ten
virgins, our Savior clearly intimates that the bridegroom
will tarry beyond the time that his people expected
him. The picture is that of a crowd of passengers
sitting in a station and waiting for a night
train which is behind time, and while they are yet
waiting they get drowsy and nod. The sentence,
<span class="tei tei-q">‘They all slumbered and slept,’</span> should more properly
be, they became <span class="tei tei-q">‘drowsy and nodded.’</span> This applies
to the very elect, who will be taken into the wedding,
and indicates a crisis of the trial of the faith of the
sanctified ones.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“But the most significant of all things in the present
crisis is the testing of true faith in all points of
doctrine. There never was a time since the fall of
Adam when the human race was so drenched with
the muddy waters of heresy. Everything moves with
lightning rapidity. The principles that lie hidden in
every system of government, education, social life,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page471">[pg 471]</span><a name="Pg471" id="Pg471" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
and manifold forms of religion, are swiftly pushing
themselves to prestige and open manifestation. Sin
is not only working out every species of wickedness
that can be invented, but the intellect of the so-called
Christianized world is showing signs of decay in its
ability to grasp sturdy Bible truth, and is largely
turning from the Bible to old worn-out heathen ideas.
Every doctrine of the Bible is being twisted into fanciful
theories. The scriptures teaching of sin and the
need of broken-hearted repentance is practically ignored
by thousands of ministers and church-members.
The absolute divinity of Jesus is growing weaker in
the faith of many who claim to teach his gospel, and
some who profess to be very orthodox say they do not
pray to Jesus. The literal resurrection of the body
taught by the Scriptures is caricatured and treated
lightly by professed theologians, ministers, and professed
Christians. The immortality of the soul and
its conscious existence, either in heaven or hell, during
the sleep of the body in death, is being rejected for
the old heathen notion. The experience of justifying
and sanctifying grace, attested by the personal Holy
Spirit, is rejected by millions of church-members.
Everlasting reward and punishment is laughed at as
an old tradition instead of a serious doctrine of the
Bible.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“It is well nigh impossible to enter a single professed
Christian family in Europe or America in
which some member has not a new patent on Scripture
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page472">[pg 472]</span><a name="Pg472" id="Pg472" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
truth and holds some fanciful notion concerning
the serious teachings of the Bible. I find a great
many passages in which the last form of testifying
for God's saints will be that of their faith in the
simple plain old doctrines of God's Word. Jesus
warns us that just before his coming every possible
heresy and every variety of false Christ will appear
to deceive the people, and that if it were possible they
should deceive the very elect. And John in Revelation
tells us of an era of the going forth of frogs, which
are evil spirits, to seduce the people from the true
faith. We are living in the frog era. In nearly every
city in the land there are from one to three persons
who claim to be God, or an incarnation of Christ,
or the Holy Spirit. Thousands of religious people
think it is too tame and uninteresting to accept all
of the plain old doctrines of the Scripture, so they
want something original and startling.”</span>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In the past two years the popular religious bodies,
including an aristocratic ministry, have turned to
worldliness at a rapid and unprecedented rate, and
what will be seen of proud formalism, socialism, and
rejection of divine truth in the circles of denominationalism
within the next ten years would now appear
incredulous.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The bringing in of the evening light by the Holy
Spirit has been the clearing away of much mystery
from prophetic texts. The voice of the angel said, in
speaking to Daniel, <span class="tei tei-q">“But thou, O Daniel, shut up the
words, and seal the book, even to the time of the
end.”</span> Dan. 12:4. We have reached the time of the
end—the evening, and the book is unsealed and revealed
and the <span class="tei tei-q">“wise understand”</span>; but <span class="tei tei-q">“none of the
wicked understand.”</span> Many texts of Revelation were
fulfilled and understood when the evening light
flashed across its pages. We will quote a few.

<span class="tei tei-q">“And I saw another angel fly in the midst of heaven,
having the everlasting gospel to preach unto them
that dwell on the earth, and to every nation, and kindred,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page478">[pg 478]</span><a name="Pg478" id="Pg478" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
and tongue, and people, saying with a loud voice,
Fear God, and give glory to him, for the hour of his
judgment is come: and worship him that made heaven,
and earth, and the sea, and the fountains of waters.
And there followed another angel saying, Babylon is
fallen, is fallen, that great city, because she made all

agent or messenger. <span class="tei tei-q">“Heaven”</span> does not refer to the
glory world above, but to the work of God and heaven
here upon earth. This angel is a messenger or servant
in the work of the Lord. He has the everlasting gospel
to preach to the people. The burden of his ministry
is, <span class="tei tei-q">“Fear God, and give glory to him; for the hour
of his judgment is come.”</span> The evening or time of the
end is reached, the hour of God's judgment, the time
of the bride's especial preparation for the coming of
the bridegroom. This ministry is closely followed
by another messenger declaring, <span class="tei tei-q">“Babylon is fallen,
is fallen, that great city, because she made all nations
drink of the wine of the wrath of her fornication.”</span>

<span class="tei tei-q">“Babylon is fallen.”</span> This is a prediction against
mystery Babylon the great and her harlot daughters—Catholicism
and Protestantism. This God's pure ministry
has been preaching for the last two decades.
Sectism is in a fallen condition. It is fallen into the
depths of worldliness. She has opened her bosom and
invited the world in to revel with her. She has prepared
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page479">[pg 479]</span><a name="Pg479" id="Pg479" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
a potion of charming delusive spirits, by which
she has intoxicated and inflamed the blood of nations.
In the last few years the concerts, fairs and socials
are frequented by both the professed Christians and
non-professors, and in their dress, conversation,
and general manner, they are undistinguishable. Sectism
to-day in not enticing people to enter her fold by
preaching the everlasting gospel, but she allures them
by her seducing love decoction of lewdness, worldliness
and licentiousness. Babylon is fallen.

Some of the Old Testament texts contain a spiritual

render unto her a recompense.”</span> Jer. 51:6. This language

<span class="tei tei-q">“Babylon hath been a golden cup in the Lord's
hand, that made all the earth drunken: the nations
have drunken of her wine; therefore the nations are
mad.”</span> Jer. 51:7. The woman (mystery Babylon
and her daughters) sitting upon the scarlet-colored
beast had a golden cup in her hand. Rev. 17:4. The
day was, as we have before spoken, when God did
save some souls in sectism and gave them the Holy
Spirit's power. But Satan has succeeded in emptying
the golden cup of that which was divine and filled it
with intoxicating potions that have allured nations
to commit fornication with her.

As the ancient literal city of Babylon typifies the
great spiritual Babylon, so the literal city of Jerusalem
typifies the spiritual Jerusalem or Zion or church
of God. God does not want his people joined unto
a sect and under the laws and creeds and authority
of man. He wants the full care of them. However,
many of God's children, through ignorance, have been
induced to seek a home in Babylon. Here they have
been taken captive. In this evening time God is leading
them back to Zion. <span class="tei tei-q">“The ransomed of the Lord
shall return and come to Zion with songs and everlasting
joy upon their heads.”</span> Isa. 35:10. The songs
of Zion are not to be sung in the barren land of Babylon.

mightily with a strong voice, saying, Babylon the

The parable of the Savior in which he likens the
kingdom of heaven unto a man which sowed good
seed in his field is also illustrative of the gospel day.
The field is the world. The Son of man sowing the
good seed is the glorious gospel work of the morning.
The enemy that sowed the tares is the apostasy,
which destroyed much of the good seed and sowed
discord, contention, strife and superstition. The
harvest-time is the evening time. The angels are
God's holy messengers.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">

forth his angels or messengers, and they shall gather

in the end of the world.

In the fifth and sixth verses of this chapter is a
beautiful prophecy of Christ. <span class="tei tei-q">“Behold, the days

In the ninth verse the prophet tells of his broken
heart because he foresees the dark apostasy. From
verse nine to verse eighteen he speaks of the wicked
doings of apostates.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In verse nineteen he describes the present holiness
reformation that is sweeping over the land. <span class="tei tei-q">“Behold,

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In the third verse of the twenty-fourth chapter of
Matthew we read of the disciples questioning the
Savior concerning the end of the world. They say,
<span class="tei tei-q">“Tell us, when shall these things be? and what shall
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page486">[pg 486]</span><a name="Pg486" id="Pg486" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
be the sign of thy coming, and of the end of the
world?”</span> In answering, the Savior in the sixth and
the following few verses speaks of political upheavals.
In the eleventh and twelfth verses he predicts
the apostasy of the noonday. <span class="tei tei-q">“Many false prophets
shall rise and shall deceive many. And because iniquity
shall abound the love of many shall wax cold.”</span>
That is why a child of God finds it so difficult to retain
an experience of salvation in sectism. Iniquity
abounds, and being yoked up with such evil companions
he can not stem the tide of influence.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In the fourteenth verse the Savior says: <span class="tei tei-q">“And this
gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the
world for a witness unto all nations; and then shall
the end come.”</span> This preaching of the gospel of the
kingdom is to be after the apostasy, and just prior
to the end of the world. Throughout sectism theology
and tradition have been substituted for the gospel,
but in the evening time John beholds an angel
flying in the midst of heaven having the everlasting
gospel to preach to them that dwell on the earth.
This is the same as the preaching of the gospel in the
end of the world to which the Savior refers. He has
now taken the disciples once down through the whole
of the Christian dispensation to the end of the world.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In the fifteenth verse he begins with them again
at the desolation spoken of by Daniel, which is the
destruction of Jerusalem in the year 70 A.D. From
the sixteenth to the twenty-second verse inclusive,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page487">[pg 487]</span><a name="Pg487" id="Pg487" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
he instructs them concerning this abomination. From
the twenty-third to the twenty-sixth inclusive he again
speaks of the apostasy. False Christs and false prophets
shall arise. In the twenty-seventh and twenty-eighth
verses he speaks of the end of the world. He
has now taken them through the Christian era again
down to the time of the end. In the twenty-ninth
verse he leads them back again to the destruction of
Jerusalem. <span class="tei tei-q">“Immediately after the tribulation of
those days [by this he refers to the destruction of
Jerusalem] shall the sun be darkened, and the moon
shall not give her light, and the stars shall fall from
heaven.”</span> This is the obscuring of Christ and the
church by the beast power in the noontime.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In the thirty-first verse he says, <span class="tei tei-q">“And he shall
send his angels with a great sound of a trumpet, and
they shall gather together his elect from the four
winds, from one end of heaven to the other.”</span> These
are the angels that are shouting, <span class="tei tei-q">“Come out of
her, my people.”</span> They are gathering out of God's
kingdom all things that do offend and them that do
iniquity. This is the work of God in the time of the

We have placed before the reader in the best manner
we could, considering our limited time, the beautiful
light and wonderful accomplishments of redeeming
grace in the morning of this gospel day. In the
apostolic period, we again repeat, the church was the
light of the world. The Christians believed the whole
Word of God. They taught the whole truth and no
more. They lived a pure, holy life just as Jesus lived
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page497">[pg 497]</span><a name="Pg497" id="Pg497" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
and just as the Bible declares that Christians must
live. They were fully consecrated to God. They
counted not their lives dear unto themselves. They
forsook all to follow Jesus and lived wholly unto him.
They had faith in God and power with him. They
were of one heart and of one soul. They all spake the
same thing. They were humble and equal. They
healed the sick, cast out devils, and raised the dead
in Jesus' name. Thus they were the light of the world.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Now the evening shall be as light as the morning.
Man, as a Christian, shall live as pure and holy and
as deeply consecrated in this evening of time as did
the Christian in the morning time. At this present
time God is raising up a people who believe, experience
and teach the whole Word of truth. They have
fled the ruins of Babylon and are proclaiming the
everlasting gospel in the fear of God and the clear
light of heaven. God is working with his pure and
consecrated ministry, confirming the Word with signs
and deeds and wonders, the same as he did with the
early ministry.

speak, and devils have been cast out. All these wonders,
and many more, have been wrought in the name
of the holy child Jesus in God's pure church within

coming years much greater things than these shall ye
hear and see. Amen.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It is recorded in the Bible that God will not hear
sinners. While this is true it has its modifications.
Those who are in wilful and stubborn rebellion against
God he will not hear, even though in a day of trouble
and fear they should call upon him. But when in the
more sober moments of life man's heart feels the influence
of the Holy Spirit inclining his desires toward
a better life, arousing the nobler aspirations of his
soul, enkindling to a brighter flame the spark of humanity;
when, though he be not in possession of God's
saving grace, under such an influence he, in sincerity
of heart, calls upon God, he will hear and answer his
call as far as consistent with the divine mind, and thus
encourage his soul on to the Christian goal.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Our boyhood days and the early days of our manhood
were spent amid the gay scenes and pleasures of
life. When in the whirl of society-life we had no serious
thoughts. There would, however, in our more
secluded hours, when naught stood between us and the
whisperings of our soul, arise thoughts of futurity.
The Holy Spirit would speak to our heart of God, of
heaven, of Christ and the blood; he would hold before
us in a beautiful picture the life of a Christian
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page499">[pg 499]</span><a name="Pg499" id="Pg499" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
journeying onward to a glory world. He would also
disclose to our view the hideousness and awfulness of
sin, and the uneasiness, discontentments, trouble and
fear attending the wicked as they journey onward to
the eternal region of woe.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In these more sober hours we would seek God for
his protection with sincere, heartfelt pledges that some
day we would serve him. God heard these prayers
and gave his protection. We now in reviewing the
scenes of those early days see the many snares and
dangers Satan had arranged for our destruction, but
out of them all the Lord delivered us. Bless his name!
There was one instance of God hearing our prayer,
though in what may be considered a trivial matter,
yet made a deep impression upon us and went far
to enforce upon us the reality of God and his Word.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
One night we had a journey of several miles to make
on horseback. It was nine o'clock when we started.
After traveling about two miles our horse became very
lame. In our pity for him we dismounted and throwing
the reins over the saddle started the horse on before
us. After some two or three miles of traveling
thus, our horse seemed much improved. For the purpose
of faster travel, we concluded to again ride. Our
attempts to catch the horse seemed in vain. Repeatedly
we tried to come up with him, but when we had
come near he would trot on before. After many unsuccessful
trials it occurred to our mind that we should
ask God to aid us. Accordingly the Father was implored
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page500">[pg 500]</span><a name="Pg50" id="Pg50" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
to cause the horse to stand that we might come
up with him. Although not a Christian we believed
there was help in God, and trusting in him we approached
the animal, speaking to him as we had before,
when he stopped and we mounting continued our lonely
journey in deep and solemn thought of the verity
of God.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In the winter of 1886-87 we became very much concerned
about our soul. A revival meeting was in
progress in the little village in which we lived. They
did not teach salvation by grace through faith as was
taught by the apostles, but we, knowing no better, and
wanting to escape the damnation of hell, and hoping
for an avenue of escape, concluded to take this. Accordingly
we gave the minister our hand one night,
and answered in the affirmative his few questions concerning
our belief in God. On our way home we
were baptized, for we were taught that the water
washed away sins. During the days following we kept
a close watch upon our heart and life to learn if there
was any change. We were disappointed. We found
that sin held the same power over us. There remained
the same uncertainty of our eternal state. The
thoughts of death had lost none of their fear, and the
grave none of its terror. We were troubled. Here we
had entered, as we hoped, a path that led to heaven,
but yet all was dark and uncertain. O God, is this all
of thy kingdom upon the earth?
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I would question the older members of our congregation
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page501">[pg 501]</span><a name="Pg501" id="Pg501" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
about their experience. Should you be called
for to-night to depart this life are you fully assured
that your home will be in heaven? Have you no fear
to meet God? They would answer me thus: <span class="tei tei-q">“We can
never know in this life just what the decision of the
Great Judge will be until we come before his awful
tribunal. In this world we can only go on the best we
can, and hope for the most in the judgment.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This was sad news to my soul. Is this all there is
in a Christian life? Where is the great peace, the
joy, the bright hope and positiveness promised in the
Bible? But thinking these old heads knew all about
the Christian life, I endeavored to console myself and
calm my fears. I very poorly succeeded, for which I
now praise God.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
One instance occurred at this time that troubled me
very greatly. One night after retiring we heard a
shout of <span class="tei tei-q">“Fire! fire!”</span> upon the street. On rushing
to the door and looking up the whole heavens above
us seemed to be one burning flame. All was on fire.
The first thought that came to our mind was, It is the
last night of this world. The earth, and all its works,
is burning up. A great fear came upon me. Whither
shall I go, and whither shall I flee from His
presence? The cause of alarm proved to be a burning
building over a hill, casting the reflection on the
dark clouds over us. We read in the Bible of a class
unfit and unprepared for heaven, that would in that
day call for the mountains and the hills to fall upon
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page502">[pg 502]</span><a name="Pg502" id="Pg502" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
them to hide them from God's presence. Here we,
trying and claiming to be a Christian, experienced just
what was said should be the experience of the wicked,
and my soul was alarmed. Earnest became our efforts
to live a better life. Fierce was our struggle against
sin, deep and firm would be the resolutions, but sin
was a hard, strong master, who ground us beneath his
iron heel. We sought every known means for relief,
walking for miles to hear a sermon to learn of a more
successful life.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Often in these days of struggle would I become
unpleasant in my home. Should my children be a
little trying, I would speak to them in a cross, snappish
way. I would see them stand back in fear
before my harsh voice, and this would sting my conscience.
A child in fear of its father! how unchristianlike!
When my wife, whom I had vowed to love
always, would not do according to my judgment I
would hastily reprove in strong language. We would
see the tears start from her eyes, and again our conscience
would be heavily smitten. Resolve after resolve
was made to be more tender and kind to our
dear ones, only to be broken by the power of impatience.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In our efforts to become more gentle and tender
we often would read an article in an old school-reader
entitled <span class="tei tei-q">“Sorrow for the Dead.”</span> In this the
writer said words like these, to the best of our
remembrance: <span class="tei tei-q">“As we look upon the cold, lifeless
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page503">[pg 503]</span><a name="Pg503" id="Pg503" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
form of some dear, departed friend, there will come
rushing to our memory, the unkind acts and deeds and
thoughts we have had toward them. This remorse of
conscience,”</span> he said, <span class="tei tei-q">“should cause us to be more
true to the living.”</span> We often would read this, and
did receive some benefit from it for the time, but we
found it powerless to conquer an irritable disposition.
We can not forbear telling the reader here, although
it is a little in the advance, that the day came when
we found the Savior in the wonders of his redeeming
love and he broke the power of sin, and by his grace
did strengthen and help us to be <span class="tei tei-q">“true to the living.”</span>
Glory, glory to his name!
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It was in the summer of 1890 that the struggle became
very desperate. The convicting hand of God lay
heavily upon me. The burden of sin lay heavily upon
my soul, especially the sin of tobacco using. We had
no man to teach us. None seemed to care, nor pity.
God, however, was humbling us down to a final decision.
One late October morning on our way to the
schoolroom, as we were teaching at that time, all
alone upon the road, God spoke peace to our soul.
Where is the pen to describe the experience of that
hour! Mine, it seems, is utterly helpless. We were
conscious of a life, power and glory, not terrestrial,
filling our entire being. The earth was lit up with a
splendor never seen before. In our days of deepest
conviction we would picture to our mind the happiness
of angels, but here we had come to the realization of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page504">[pg 504]</span><a name="Pg504" id="Pg504" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
something that far surpassed all we had imagined of
the heavenly host. We felt like we wanted to sing
and praise God forever. Wife had received a similar
experience in her home a few days before. Our home
at once became a heaven. We remembered in pity
those who had endeavored to comfort us in our fears
and tell us there was no better way.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Two weeks passed of uninterrupted glory. However,
one morning after about two weeks, when doing
some work which went wrong, we were strongly
tempted to speak as we had formerly done on such
occasions, but we overcame. The second time the
work went wrong as previously, when the temptation
came stronger than before. We felt something unpleasant
within us; however, God helped us to overcome,
and we set to doing the work over, when it
went wrong the third time. This time we were overcome
and gave utterance to a word that brought a
sense of guilt. No sooner had we spoken than we fell
upon our knees and did not arise until we knew we
were forgiven. By this experience we became conscious
of a foe within us that was going to give us
trouble in the Christian life.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
About this time we providentially received a copy
of a holiness paper, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">The Gospel Trumpet</span></span>, which
taught a higher life, namely, entire sanctification.
This came as a light from heaven. We began to
earnestly seek this experience. Before we reached
this experience there were a few other occurrences in
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page505">[pg 505]</span><a name="Pg505" id="Pg505" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
our Christian life of which we wish to speak. At
this time we were very ignorant of the Bible. It was
our custom to have prayer at the schoolroom after the
children were all gone to their homes. We would then
go to our home with a heavenly glory resting upon
us. One evening on our way home, we met a company
of our former worldly associates. They accosted
us in their customary worldly way. We replied
somewhat under the influence of their worldly
spirit. I felt the glory depart, and an emptiness instead.
I went on my way hastily, asking God to
smile upon me again. He taught me by this that he
had chosen me out of the world and its witticisms,
and that slang phrases were foreign to his salvation.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Soon after this, one morning in November when
laboring in my garden a transparent glory shone all
around me, and my soul was filled with peace. It
was on election day. After working a few hours amid
rapturous bliss, we went to the place of voting and
cast our ballot along with political men. A shade
came over my spirit, and for the remainder of the
day it appeared that God had forsaken me and would
never smile on me again. He taught me once more
that he had chosen me out of the world and that
politics in civil government was foreign to the kingdom
of heaven.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The Christmas-time drew near, and great preparations
were being made by the people for their festivities.
In these we found nothing congenial to our
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page506">[pg 506]</span><a name="Pg506" id="Pg506" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
spirit. We had decided to remain at home on the
night of these festivities and have a protracted Bible
reading and prayers. We looked forward to the evening
with pleasure, expecting great blessings from God.
Just before we were ready to begin our Bible reading
wife was taken with a severe aching in the head,
that threatened to mar the enjoyment of the evening.
We wondered why it was that God permitted us to
be thus interrupted, when the Holy Spirit whispered,
<span class="tei tei-q">“If you will ask God, he will heal her.”</span> Accordingly
we fell upon our knees and petitioned God for his
healing virtue, and instantly she was healed. This
was our first experience in divine healing.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In the following February a Holy Ghost minister
came to our place and held a short series of meetings.
He taught us the way of God more perfectly. We
entered the glorious experience of entire sanctification
during this meeting. We also beheld the body of
Christ, the one true church, and saw in a clear light
the monstrous beast religion in all her evils. God
soon after called us into his work. We sold our little
home, all we had of this world, and used the means
in the work of the Lord. Our work for God has
been independent of the creeds of men, teaching a full
salvation and trusting God for everything. We have
held meetings in over twelve of the different states,
and have never asked for money. Not on one single
occasion have we taken up a collection. It would require
volumes to tell of the many times the Lord has
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page507">[pg 507]</span><a name="Pg507" id="Pg507" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
blessedly answered our prayers. God has never
called us to any conspicuous position in this world.
The great faith for the building of orphanages and
homes, and establishing missions has been entrusted
to other men. Our faith has been only for our daily
bread and needs. Oh, what an assurance our heavenly
Father gives us that he will never forsake us.
We do not want the riches of this world. We would
rather not have them. There is a blessedness in taking
our every want to Jesus. To look unto him daily
for your temporal as well as spiritual support has a
strong tendency to draw one very near to him.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
We would take pleasure in telling you of many of
the instances in which God has heard and answered
our prayers, but fearing you will take less pleasure in
reading we will forbear, only saying that God has
been petitioned for corn for our horse, and the prayer
answered in a marvelous way before the day was
over. We have asked God for a spool of thread, and
our prayer has been answered at once. One time
wife was on her knees asking God for soap, when there
was a rap at the door, and upon opening it a lady
presented her with a bar of soap. Almost daily the
Lord is petitioned for flour, meat, sugar, or clothes,
and he always gives us what we need. It is wonderful
and just as glorious as it is wonderful. In fact,
such a life is made up of glory.

glory is. Not long since we were much in need of a
dollar. In searching through my vest pocket for a
match I found a dollar bill all neatly rolled up.
Where it came from, and how, I never knew, only that
the Lord sent it. Just last night, our twelve-year-old
daughter said, <span class="tei tei-q">“This is the last Sunday I can
wear these shoes. Unless I get a new pair I shall
have to stay at home.”</span> We asked her if she had
been asking the Lord for a pair. She answered,
<span class="tei tei-q">“Yes, sir.”</span> This morning in our family devotions
we made especial mention, amid some other things, of
the shoes. In less than two hours a Christian man
came to the door and presented her with a pair. Yes,
we would rather have a faith and trust in God than
the wealth of a world. We feel more secure.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The times God has healed different ones of our
family we are unable to number. For the past eight
years he, and he only, has been our physician. We
have not in that time spent one cent for medicine.
We have three children, aged four, six, and eight
years, who have never tasted medicine. They never
were given a dose of any kind of soothing syrups or
<span class="tei tei-q">“teas.”</span> God has always healed from the toothache to
a broken limb. It does not take much of the Lord's
means to provide for us. We wear no superfluous
clothing. Our daily fare is plain and common. We
use no stimulants, narcotics, nor medicines, and consequently
just a few pennies a day is all we need.
God in his great goodness supplies all these, while
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page509">[pg 509]</span><a name="Pg509" id="Pg509" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
we go telling the world of the wonderful blessings of
salvation.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
We are at present engaged in ministerial work without
salary. In all our meetings we take up no collection,
we ask for no money in any way of man, and
we have no other source of support but in God alone.
Just as the apostles lived in the morning light, so we
live in the evening light. Just what they enjoyed, we
enjoy. In their preaching they gave God's people
warning of the apostasy. In our ministry we preach,
<span class="tei tei-q">“Come out of her, my people.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
We enjoy more of the love of God than ever before.
His very life and power and glory fills our
soul to the full. We are led exclusively by his Spirit
and are fed and clothed by his bountiful hand. Our
life is one of blessed contentment. Our home is a
heaven and our happiness is complete. Even as we
write, the waves of glory roll over our soul until we
are made to shout praises to our God. We have never
a care nor a sorrow, but a faith and trust in God
that keeps us above every wave of trouble. We are
dead to the world and living alone for his glory. His
great heart's love sweetens and tenders every fiber of
our soul, and bids us wait in brighter hope the happy
day when he shall call us to our home.
